GIGABYTE,RTX5070Ti|OC GAMING,RTX 5070 Ti,"Incredible quality build. The price of this graphic card is 300 or 400 USD lower than 5080 and it’s almost the same performance with equal memory GBs. This model is huge, so make sure that you have good space in your case. It is silent, pretty beauty and its cooling is really well designed. I have the “silent mode” on (which turns off the fans when the usage is not increasing the temperature that much) and it actually performs perfectly. I have used other brands (e.g. ASUS TUF and MSI Gaming Trio) for prior RTX gpus and I can tell you it’s completely reaching the same level or even higher.",5,"September 15, 2025",Amazon
GIGABYTE,RTX5070Ti|OC GAMING,RTX 5070 Ti,"I ended up purchasing a 4k ultra wide monitor recently and use it with a 2 monitor setup. Both running 240 hz at all times. When I made the switch I realized my old card ( RTX4070 )couldn’t handle what was basically 3 monitors running 4k 240 hz and my frames dropped significantly. ( -60 fps ) after switching to the 5070 ti I have gained a significant amount of frames. Everything looks better as I can have much higher quality settings in my games. And even games that don’t take advantage of the AI features with the new DLSS - for example Helldivers 2 runs way better at around 120-160 fps depending on the area you are in. The Nvidia software makes it super easy to mess with fan settings if you are into that and has their own way to overclock it automatically based on your computers needs. All graphics cards are expensive right now but this one I would say is worth the money. My brother ended up buying the 5090 and while his frame rates are obviously better it’s not by a crazy amount maybe 30-50 frames difference depending on the game and quality settings. For a fraction of the price of a 5090 you get nearly the performance and that’s a win. Also the thing is huge and heavy. It feels like you are holding something powerful when you are installing it, like putting an aftermarket exhaust on your car.",5,"August 14, 2025",Amazon
GIGABYTE,RTX5070Ti|OC GAMING,RTX 5070 Ti,Good card but is it too much to ask to throw in a 12VHPWR cable instead of this stupid mess of a 16 pin daisy chain adapter?,3,"October 4, 2025",Amazon
GIGABYTE,RTX5070Ti|OC GAMING,RTX 5070 Ti,Are you kidding me? DP ports are WAAAYYYY too close together...you can't get 3 quality DP cables plugged in side by side by side. This is terrible planning for the $$$$ of a card.,3,"October 18, 2025",Amazon
GIGABYTE,RTX5070Ti|OC GAMING,RTX 5070 Ti," The RX 9070 XT now performs 7-9% better than the RTX 5070 ti while easily being $100 cheaper if not more because NVIDIA can’t be asked to make decent drivers! Original: Horrible value for the money, crazy that it costs $969 when Amazon was selling ASUS’s top TUF model for $1099 (just a dual slot card unlike this one from gigabyte). Make it make sense NVIDIA & Amazon! Buy AMD because they at least try to act like they care about gamers. My card did have a little excess of gigabytes thermal gel, but not enough to drip (yet). Also it comes with a 4 year warranty instead of the standard 3. So probably a decent deal for what it is IF you can get it in the $800 range.
Now about NVIDIA- this probably the most crashing & instability I’ve seen so far from a NVIDIA GPU. Probably 90% driver issues considering NVIDIA is possessed by the lure of AI & one poor software engineer is left to make functional drivers by made-up deadlines. Absolutely zero reason to support NVIDIA & their behavior especially when they are buying reviews from major publications. NVIDIA has only been giving access to drivers ahead of their launch if you accept their money & testing program to only test very specific games at very specific settings to further support their outrageous marketing claims. Whoever is running NVIDIA marketing has completely ruined any remaining trust individual customers had in them. They only care about their big money enterprise deals, NVIDIA has gone the same route as Apple in terms of corporate authoritarianism.",1,"April 28, 2025",Amazon
ASUS,ROG-STRIX-RTX4080-O16G-GAMING,RTX 4080,"Pros: I have the white Asus ROG Strix 3080 and I thought that was and is a very beautiful card but then I got this one and now I am torn as to which is more beautiful.
When I first got this it was running a good 20 degrees cooler than my 3080Ti playing the same game. I am only playing at 1440p and haven't really pushed it but I have no doubt it will crush any game I throw at it.
Fits fine in my Lian Li 011 EVO in the vertical position using the Lian Li vertical mount but I saw that it may not fit in the true vertical in the side of the case though I haven't tried it yet..
I bought an extension cable that plugs directly into my power supply so I didn't have to use the ugly mess of the black adapter that comes with it.
I did use a GPU brace and I suggest everyone do the same as this is a massive and heavy card.

Cons: After running it for some time now the cooling ability seems to have decreased but is still 10 degrees cooler than my 3080Ti. I am hoping it will not degrade much further.
You will need a case large enough to for it to fit and some kind of brace but that is a known and not really a con.
I sometimes wish the fans were illuminated.

Overall Review: I was going to skip this generation when I heard they weren't going to make a white card but bought this one as soon as I saw it and I am not disappointed.
I do wish it cost less because of course I do.
I would highly recommend this card if you can afford it and it is something you want.
My experience with it is still limited but I am very happy with my purchase.
I would keep a close eye on temps to see if they keep increasing with use.
You may also find it difficult not to stare at it.",5,3/6/2023,Newegg
ASUS,ROG-STRIX-RTX4080-O16G-GAMING,RTX 4080,"Overall Review: I recently upgraded from an MSI Gaming Trio 3080 12gb to the Asus Rog Strix 4080. It's early on but the 4080 is a noticeable upgrade overall. I've seen much improved rendering times in Davinci and the gaming performance is excellent. The installation was seamless and (as expected) has performed without issues over many hours of continuous use.

The build quality has a solid high end feel with metal throughout. Fine 3d machined details and dark metallic gray finish sets this card apart from other versions. A couple splashes of color look nice against the monochrome finish on the fan side. However, they are barely visible when the card is conventionally installed if it's not your thing.

The RGB lighting adds to the 4080's presence in the case without being overbearing. The unique ring of lighting at the end of the card and the overall esthetics remind me of something from Tron. That's a good thing.

This is a massive and impressive looking beast in person. Too large for my compact NZXT h510 Elite. I had to upgrade to a Corsair D5000 Airflow case, which allows it to fit comfortably.

I recommend getting an ATX 3.0 PSU for this card if you want to reduce your cable count. You can use the included three headed extension but the ATX 3.0 allows you to use a cable with a single connection on each side. One end goes to the new 12VHPWR connector on the PSU side instead of three pcie cords.

Long story short, I highly recommend the ROG Strix 4080 of you desire the next level of performance. As a gaming and video editing guy, I couldn't be more pleased. It not only has amazing performance but looks the part as well.",5,12/11/2022,Newegg
ASUS,ROG-STRIX-RTX4080-O16G-GAMING,RTX 4080,"Card performed well in tasks from 1080p and 1440p resolutions.
Fan operation Silent
Cool Temps while playing the latest AAA games
Good for general application use

Cons: Coil whine. At full load this thing whines non-stop and almost sounded like a zapper (if paying any game, despite capping frames, etc. Not as bad as when it was idle but still present.

Overall Review: My first time picking up a 4000 series card (coming from 1060) and I liked the overall performance the card provided from what I saw and the design. Despite the positive performance of the card, the coil whine is by far the most annoying thing I have ever heard. Maybe my card was unfortunate to have it, but still it was annoying to deal with with a silent based build. Currently in process of return for a replacement in which I am hoping the replacement card will be better. For a 1200 plus tax card, should not have to deal with any coil whine with all of the parts being paired with the GPU",3,4/3/2023,Newegg
ASUS,ROG-STRIX-RTX4080-O16G-GAMING,RTX 4080,"Pros: * Temps stay below 60C with hotspots below 70C
* Overclocks to just over 3 GHz
* Looks better in person than in pictures

Cons: * Coil whine, coil whine, coil whine. It is very loud.
* It's a giant cooler that will barely fit any cases. Even in my open-air Thermaltake Core P3, the vertical mounting of the GPU is 1.5 inches away from the glass.
* Could only get a stable overclock of +4% fps at 3000 to 3045 MHz

Overall Review: Overall it works very well since it is the 4080 after all. I use it with a 5800X3D and QHD 240hz monitor. It is far over priced, though, has high coil whine, and doesn't have significant overclocking headroom of 7-10%. Just go for the FE or cheaper variants than the strix.


",3,11/30/2022,Newegg
ASUS,ROG-STRIX-RTX4080-O16G-GAMING,RTX 4080,"Pros: - Looks amazing.
- Compact, relative to the 4000 series GPU's. It's still HUGE.

Cons: - Loud.
- Bigger than it seems.
- Erratic fan control.
- High pitched fan noise profile.
- No bios switch, ie software required for many features.
- Premium price despite tiny OC.

Overall Review: This is the 3rd time I've tried reviewing this GPU, but Newegg continuously refuses to approve any of them. So if you're seeing this version, be aware I seemingly had to tone my review down to get it approved, at least hopefully.

That aside, my whole reason for trying to review this GPU so many times is simple. There are alternatives people interesting in this card for it's appearance may be overlooking due to the extra performance a 4080 potentially has. The problem is that while compact coolers are entirely possible with the 40 series GPU's, Asus hasn't succeeded. The cooler simply can't keep up in heavier loads, causing the fans to far outpace the advertised fan noise levels and in a very grating high pitched way.

While I can't say for sure that the other Asus cards available with this cooler would perform better, a lower TGP card logically outputs less heat and thus should run cooler and quieter. Plus the 4070 Ti, 4070, or 4060 versions are substantially cheaper. But if the 4080 performance is key to your applications, this specific version still doesn't make much sense.

This is the so called ""OC"" variant, which just means it comes factory ""overclocked"", but otherwise is just a 2nd higher priced SKU of a the non-OC 4080 variant of this GPU. Usually that higher price is easy to justify for people that don't want to overclock a card themselves, and it's especially easy to quantify as a simple dollar:clock ratio. For the ProArt 4080 OC, Asus just threw their typical dollar:clock ratio out the window. So really the best option if you need a 4080 and want it in the same style - just get the non-OC version. You'll be able to achieve the factory OC this card has with ease, you just have to do it in their software or one of the many alternatives.

That brings me to probably my biggest annoyance with this cards though, and it technically applies to every card currently in the ProArt line. The card is hampered if you don't or can't use the Asus software to control it. There's no physical BIOS button to change profiles despite the advertising slyly showing an OC and default mode multiple places. Everything has to be handled through their software. So if you can't use it, you only get the profile that comes pre-loaded on the card. But I'm still not completely sure how the profiles work with this card, so if I say much more it starts to be me just speculating. What's important is that Asus did something different here, and it makes adjusting settings for the GPU extremely difficult on a lot of systems.

So ultimately, would I recommend this card to anyone?
Yes and No.
Yes for how it looks, for the aesthetics, and for very specific situations where the fans won't be heard but the system may still be seen.

No, and double no, because there are better options.
Options that look identical, because they actually are as far as the cooler goes.
And no because the premium this card asks could instead be used to make your computer stronger elsewhere, or just be saved for your next upgrade.

There's no denying the ProArt GPU's look great. I absolutely loved it from that point of view. But practicality wise? I couldn't deal with the fans being so erratic, spinning to 60-80% regularly, not having a BIOS switch, all for that price...


",1,10/13/2023,Newegg
SAPPHIRE,NITRO+ Radeon RX 7900,Radeon RX 7900,"Pros: - The card fits smaller cases, I have a Meshify C and you can see it fits with literally no room to spare with two 140mm fans up front.
- Runs very quiet
- Runs cool
- Looks great!
- This card feels very high quality
- No coil whine
- Runs everything maxed out with no issues!

Cons: - The only con is the GPU bracket holes are too small to use the same screws from the case when installing it, luckily it comes with extra screws that I made work.

Overall Review: - Overall this is an amazing card and in the end its a 7900 xtx, it will run over anything and beats the 4080 in most.
- This will be the last card you need for many years which is why I invested in it.
- I had trouble finding any reviews for this particular card but if you are like me please rest assured this is one of the better models you can get for build quality, cool temps, and will fit in more cases
- Also it comes from Sapphire! there is a reason they are AMDs #1 AIB.",5,3/2/2023,Newegg
SAPPHIRE,NITRO+ Radeon RX 7900,Radeon RX 7900,"Pros: - Relatively quiet even when overclocking
- Compact by modern standards. Easily fits in NZXT H1 case (see photo).
- ""COD MW2"", ""The last of us"" in 4k performance is amazing!
- 24Gb VRAM will make sure this card stays relevant for many years
- 2 HDMI + 2 Display Ports

Cons: - No RGB. Would be nice if at least sapphire logo had it. Not a deal breaker for me.

Overall Review: Great card with good cooling and that can easily fit in most small cases. Only ref design card is smaller but this one has slightly better cooling. While I was playing ""The Last Of Us"" temperature in tiny NZXT H1 case didn't go above 74C while remaining relatively quiet. No coil whine, no hassle with installation - simply installed latest adrenaline driver after swapping old 3070 and its good to go.
I'm very happy with the purchase! I had Sapphire cards in the past and they never let me down.",5,3/29/2023,Newegg
SAPPHIRE,NITRO+ Radeon RX 7900,Radeon RX 7900,"Pros: Fast delivery. Sleek looking and size fits nicely into the CoolerMaster NR200P itx case.

Cons: Runs much warmer than other AIB cards due to cooling system design and smaller heatsink - which is also why it looks sleek and has a good size.

Overall Review: 11.1.2023 - Quick delivery to Singapore - ordered on 5th Jan and arrived Singapore by 8th. First day of testing I've ran FurMark at 4k preset and getting max temps of 72C GPU, 96C memory junction, and 85% hotspot (mounted vertically). Will continue testing over next couple of days after I've upgraded my cpu to 5800x3d and mount the card horizontally.

Update on 20.1.2023 - Temps are much hotter horizontally at 106C memory junction at 80-90% load. Read that some people with 'normal' cards later developed 110C junction temp issues after weeks of usage. This is a concern to me as I live in Singapore and warranty is only available with manufacturer in the US after 6 months (Newegg's international return policy for Singapore specifically ). Instead of enjoying the GPU, I am constantly monitoring temps - which is not right after spending US$1200 on a top-of-the-range AMD GPU. I am in the process of returning this for a refund since I am still within the 30-day return period. I hope Newegg understands my circumstances, given (1) the publicized heating issues for the 7900 xtx reference cards and (2) my limited warranty period given that I do not reside in the US, and won't charge me return shipping/restocking fees for this particular borderline case.",3,1/20/2023,Newegg
SAPPHIRE,NITRO+ Radeon RX 7900,Radeon RX 7900,"Pros: - Easy to setup
- Speeds were as intended, when not hot.
- Newegg worked well with me on refund.

Cons: - Hotspot issue. 90c+ temps in most games at default settings. (Heaven Benchmarks, Wow, Star Citizen) Escape from Tarkov ran the coolest out of any game(80-95c).
- During heavy load, easy reach 100c-110c
- Undervolt had little to no affect on temp.
- Don't even think about OC (Rage would reach 110c in seconds)

Overall Review: 3 stars. Had no issue working with Newegg on RMA process.
- Obviously, Hotspot temp is the only issue. 30c-40c delta majority of the time
- Fortunately, i was able to snag an AIB 7900 xtx card. I'd stay clear of any reference cards, for the time being, as I received no response from AMD on if the issue has been contained or if its safe to purse replacements and not expect same issue. Not worth the money on ""chance"" of receiving a good card, especially anything over MSRP.


",3,1/20/2023,Newegg
SAPPHIRE,NITRO+ Radeon RX 7900,Radeon RX 7900,"Pros: Great performance in non ray traced games. Even ray traced games were playable.
Star Citizen played with GPU utilization under 100%
Fans were much quieter than anticipated

Cons: Thermals were at 105 or sometimes above in games.
Idle Watt usage was always at 100W to 115W and 115W was consistent. (1440p 144hz monitor and 1080p 75hz monitor.)
Poor performance in ray tracing compared to the competition, though massively improved over the 6000 series

Overall Review: Performance is amazing if you can keep it from thermal throttling and running hot 76 degrees on idle with 100-115 watt usage all the time. I sent mine back and have picked up an alternative for the time being. I would hold off until AMD can resolve this and guarantee all effected units are off the market.",1,1/24/2023,Newegg
GIGABYTE,Vision OC GeForce RTX 3060,RTX 3060,"Overall Review: I just built a new PC from scratch to beef up my home office and I was waiting to find a GPU like everyone else. I work with AutoCAD and I also game on this PC. I previously purchased an open box Asus RX6600 for a really great deal at my local Micro-disregardthistext-Center (about $300) and they even gave me a free extended warranty on the card because it was missing some non-essential cables.

I was still in the NewEgg Shuffle and about a week after I purchased the 6600, I won the shuffle for this RTX3060. I tested out both and they are pretty equal in my use case.
I ended up giving my teenage son the 6600 and I kept the 3060. I'm happy with the 3060 and he is grateful that I gave him the upgrade from his RX580!

Prices and availability are still ridiculous with GPUs. If you are looking for 1080p Ultra settings and this card is available for a good price, grab it.

ASRock,Phantom Gaming Radeon RX 7900,Radeon RX 7900,"Pros: -Cheap compared to 4080ti with similar performance
-Very strong graphics card. I've been running MW2 at 200+ FPS on Ultra settings and Warzone 2.0 around 220-250fps on Perfomance settings with some High/Ultra on select settings.
-Software is very easy to use, can easily overclock if you wish or change graphic settings globally or per game. I keep mine non-OC'd as I don't really play games on high settings.

Cons: -Usually run hotter than my previous cards, however, I've not had any overheating problems like some people may have experienced with MBA design cards. After tuning the fans, my card usually sits at around 40c and 45c junction temps and under ultra settings load on MW2/Warzone 2.0, High on Life, GTA V, and others, temps usually sit at around 70c and junction temp at 85c. I've never had my junction temp reach above 90c.
-Fans can be loud when under a lot of stress, but that is normal I guess.
-Driver software is not as good as Nvidia but still easy to use and you can do quite a lot with it.

Overall Review: - Overall, would recommend the product. Decently priced high performance card. Can run hot but can easily be fixed by tuning fan speeds. Probably can make it cooler even when ultra settings if you tune the fans, if you don't mind the fans sounding like there's a jet engine beside you.
- At least for the card that I have received, I never had any overheating issue or any situations when the card peaked or went over 90c.
- If you're looking to build a high end gaming PC and has the budget but don't want to spend over $2000 cad for 4090. This is a very good card with very good performance.",5,1/7/2023,Newegg
ASRock,Phantom Gaming Radeon RX 7900,Radeon RX 7900,"Pros: Really good high refresh rate 1440P gaming.
Decently cool and quite.
Relatively good price to performance.

Cons: RT performance isn't there.

Overall Review: Honestly one of the best price to performance options out there if you are a max settings 1440P gamer, if you can swallow todays prices of GPU's. Paired with a 5800X3D, pretty decent rasterization. Its a 390W TBP GPU out of the box. No coil whine and the fans even at 100% aren't too bad. Definitely can hear em, but definitely not jet engine loud either. Was pleasantly surprised how well of a job the cooling solution does. Generally speaking if you lock 60-80fps for most modern games it uses under 200W. Yes Nvidia is by far the best performance per watt, but honestly if you down clock to never go over 2400mhz, its a 300w card. I honestly prefer a 4080 for CUDA, RT, DLSS and power efficiency, but for the little bit of savings its definitely worth a look. One big selling point was the 24GB buffer and better re-bar(SAM) support with my 5800X3D. But as a 1440P gamer I have yet to see more than 12GB used, so anyone considering a 12GB card and 1440P, you are good to go! FYI, anyone wondering it ramps up to 2700mhz game clock, which is pretty high. I have a Quest 2 VR headset, nice to see it works flawlessly. I was honestly a little concerned after I already ordered the card and seen the reviews of the graphical glitches some were having. I'd also like to note I use the USB3 cable, not wifi, just to clarify. Maybe that helps? With AI being the latest rage, I just can't see prices coming down much in the future, and since the world is in a recession, high end gaming is definitely becoming a luxury. But at time of buying, it was a 75% price increase over a 6800 XT for a 50-60% performance gain. I'd say its a good card, just not a great card. Exact same PCB as the tiachi if you are thinking about water blocking it.
Driver level for the 2 display power problem has been fixed for me, using Pixio PQ329(2560x1440@165hz) and MSI 401QR(3440x1440@155hz). Radeon chill is actually pretty cool, I usually do a global setting of 60 and 90. The way it works is its 60 fps if I don't have any input from kb/mouse, but the more you use your kb/mouse/gamepad etc, the fps ramp up to 90 fps, I'm actually pretty impressed how well it works, WTG AMD!

ASRock,Phantom Gaming Radeon RX 7900,Radeon RX 7900,"Pros: - Capable of getting 144Hz on 3840 x 2160 on demanding competitive games such as Apex Legends
- Better power delivery and higher max TDP at default and at max 15% slider in Radeon Drivers
- Size of this GPU is on the lower end at 330mm and ""only"" 3 slots as opposed to other aftermarket GPUs that are in excess of 335mm and/or quad slot cards
- AMD AV1 harware encoder works with latest OBS at the time of this writing (OBS 29.0.0)
- subjective: design of the GPU itself in terms of look and ARGB is pretty nice to me

Cons: - Not huge FPS increase in 1080p or 1440p as many, if not most, games will be CPU bound or engine limit bound.
- Possibly rushed job on ASrock's end on putting the GPU together; screws for the heatsink mount were not tight, as I was able to do multiple extra turns on 3 out of the 4 screws on the mount. Also rescrewed on backplate because initially memory junction was getting over 100C even at stock during Timespy benchmarking.
- Prior to tightening the screws, Memory junction was hitting excess of 100C. Now it is at high 80-86C max even with max 15% power limit, indicating bad contact with either backplate or heatsink.
- Possibly bad thermal paste application? The GPU still hits 104C, though on average it seems to be around 80s during gaming. Though this is after undervolting the GPU via Andrenaline slider to 1082mV, but with max 15% power limit and maxing fan profile.
- Running at default settings on everything on AMD drivers caused weird instability with window mode for games, particularly low end or less demanding games, such that they crashed.
- High wattage for idle or content consuming at 110-120W while using 2x 4k displays and a third 1080p display. Has not been fixed with drivers.
- ASrock still includes their ""Void warranty if removed"" sticker on one of the four heatsink mounting screws of the GPU. I've seen many reports across the web where they have used this to deny warranty or RMA simply because the sticker is gone either because it fell off or the end user swapped thermal paste or pads. Kinda terrible on ASrock's end to still enforce this policy. Basically I can't repaste this GPU until the warranty is up, even if the GPU might have a poor thermal paste job unless I want to RMA over ""high temperatures"" (which will probably either be denied as ""within spec"" or complete avoidance in responding).

Overall Review: EDIT 2023/4/13: It's been several months, and the GPU hot spot temperatures eventually hit 110C regularly. I attempted to see how the thermal paste application is on the GPU and found that the mounting is awful (seen in new attached picture). I did a first repaste, and found the temperatures still awful, so opened it up again, but this time I attempted to press down and mold the thermal pads on the VRAM modules a little bit and reapplied thermal paste. After remounting and screwing it back up, I am happy to say that my temperatures no longer go over 90C on the hot spot, and memory Junction is healthy under 85C as well. In conclusion, the mounting and contact of the die to the heatsink is awful made worse by having possibly too thick thermal pads on all the VRAM modules surrounding the die. If you find similar 100+ C tempteraures at stock I recommend returning and getting another if you don't want the hassle of trying to deal with repasting and remounting and molding the VRAM thermal pads.

Cons: Vapor chamber design only works well when the GPU is in a normal orientation. This limits how you can set up your system.

Overall Review: Being a vapor chamber design, cooling relies on gravity (instead of traditional convection) and the cold plate to be the lowest point in the loop. So you are limited to your case selection, which for most it'll be fine, but if you want to use a case like The Thermaltake Tower series, you don't want this type of cooler. Vertical mounting will result in dangerously high junction temperatures because the vapor inside the chamber will not ""drop"" into the cold plate when it gets cooled by the fans.

ASRock,Phantom Gaming Radeon RX 7900,Radeon RX 7900,"Pros: - The card runs well when playing desktop games, VR, and editing. Haven't had any issues aside from when Helldivers 2 came out.

- Easy to set up and use.

- Good card for the price.

Cons: - Temps in the center/hot spot go up to 100+ even at full blast fan speed, I don't think that's normal..
- Loud coil whine as soon as your frames get a little too high
- Fans are obnoxiously loud even at 60% fan speed

I'm only 8 months in with this new card and one of the fan bearings sounds abysmal, between 40-60% fan speed it sounds like a Geiger counter. Support has yet to get back to me on this issue.

Overall Review: If the warranty was longer and ASRock support would reply as soon as they could to issues like these, I wouldn't have a problem recommending this graphics card. But the support has been less than favorable and the GPU has been one of the fastest cards I've had issues with by far.

GIGABYTE,AERO GeForce RTX 4070,RTX 4070,"Pros: - Super easy to install, requires only one 8-pin connector.
- Runs awesomely, all games run super well on this. Keep in mind many new gen games are NOT optimized so if you get low frames, it's most likely due to a CPU limitation or the game is bad...
- 3 Fan setup, one not seen, two easily visible. Runs nice and cool. I have not gotten it above 55 C, whereas my old 1650 S was getting to 80-85 C on current gen games.

Cons: - Power consumer. Sometimes when launching games or when higher demanding applications use a lot of power, sometimes Windows finds it necessary shut down USB devices, even after disabling selective suspension. Not sure if its just a me issue or if I just need a better power supply, I have a 700 W currently so idk.
- This thing is huge. I have an ATX Mid-Tower so it filled the thing up so much I had to move some cables around. Keep this in mind when buying.

Overall Review: I love this graphics card, and I am loyal to Gigabyte because of the quality of the build. The 40xx series cards are top of the line and can take on anything you throw at it. Definitely a excellent alternative if you don't have the money for a 4080 or 4090. I plan on using this card for at least a couple years.

I use V-sync therefore I am not seeking the highest framerate, I'm looking for stability mainly. Baldur's Gate 3, Starfield, Red Dead 2, No Man's Sky, and Hell Let Loose all ran at Ultra or Max settings at 1440p perfectly. Honestly Starfield was the only one that actually stressed the GPU but it was actually my CPU that was causing my grief when it came to performance.

GIGABYTE,AERO GeForce RTX 4070,RTX 4070,"Pros: -Great performance
-DLSS 3.0
-Dual Bios
-Overclocks fairly well in my testing so far.
-Good Temps
-Nice clean look
-Metal Backplate with cool design

Cons: -Only con so far is in its Aesthetics. I like the looks of the Card except for the fans having the teal color that can't be changed unless you paint them. would like to see them be white with ARGB so you can customize the colors.

Overall Review: I'm really enjoying the card so far. I had a RTX 2070 previously, so the jump is very noticeable in games at 1440p and 4k. DLSS 3.0 is great as well for games that are more demanding. For example, I was running Hogwarts Legacy on my 2070 at 4k with DLSS turned on to performance with raytracing off and most settings on High it would sometimes drop below 60fps in demanding areas, with the 4070 i have everything on ultra with DLSS set to Quality and I'm getting better framerates in all areas of the game. I can even turn on Raytracing to Medium or High with Frame Generation on and get a pretty steady 60fps. The frame gen does feel weird because of the increased input latency. In all games I've tried I'm able to turn the graphics quality up and get better framerates and that's all I ask for when upgrading a video card. The addition of DLSS 3 is an added bonus. Overall, the card is great and would recommend it if you have a card older than the 30 series. I just wish Nvidia hadn't made DLSS 3.0 exclusive to 40 series cards.

GIGABYTE,AERO GeForce RTX 4070,RTX 4070,"Pros: Works well, easy install. Playing games in 4k and they look amazing.

Cons: This thing is really loud when the graphics are turned up. They really should have gone with quieter fans. To the point I have to put on my headset to hear the game sometimes. I have a Silverstone RV-01 case with amazing airflow so cooling issues are not a problem for my case. Would defiantly recommend that they buy some ""be quiet!"" fans or something better to put in it.

Overall Review: Overall I am satisfied with the card, but not enthusiastic about it. If not for sounding like a server farm in my living room when playing 4k games, this would have gotten a 5 egg review",3,6/12/2024,Newegg
GIGABYTE,AERO GeForce RTX 4070,RTX 4070,"Pros: Works great and I haven't been able to reach it's limits for my particular usage. The price was fair for what it is.

Cons: It runs loud with minimal load and sits at 55C-60C with a room temperature of 68-62. When I say loud it's not too bad but I can hear it fluctuate as play some games.

Overall Review: I would buy again and look into a case that allows me to have fans on the side of fhe case to bring in more fresh air.

ASRock,Radeon RX 6900 XT PHANTOM GAMING,RX 6900,"Pros: Out of the box, this thing beats the average on all tests. Passmark GPU test shows 28,000+ points for this card, and the average for a 6900 XT is 25,000 points or so. This is more than competitive with the 3090 which averages 26,000. A couple of tweaks and you can probably get this thing past 30,000 easily.

Cons: Not really a con, but you should know that it is huge at over 13"" long and triple slot. Also it recommends a 1000w power supply. Buildzoid from Actual Hardcore Overclocking, looked at the power delivery on this card and it's very well built (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azvn6H1vX28), but can require more power in transient loads. If you want the best air-cooled 6900 XT, you have to know what you're getting.

Overall Review: No load that I've thrown at this thing even makes it work hard. It's a beast of a card, and it should be for this tier of product. In an age where RTX3090 is twice the price, this thing is faster in everything but raytracing, but it does that too. That's a bargain right now.",5,1/9/2022,Newegg
ASRock,Radeon RX 6900 XT PHANTOM GAMING,RX 6900,"Pros: - Excellent frame rates at 3440x1440
- Runs relatively cool (mid 40's idle and mid 60's to high 70's depending on game being played)
- RGB is tasteful
- Arrived unscathed from NewEgg (good job) packaged well
- Card looks and feels very well built.

Cons: - Card is massive and just barely fits in my Corsair Crystal 680X (seriously 1mm longer and it doesn't fit)
- I dont care for the red highlights, I realize its AMD etc, etc...but manufacturers need to just make cards black or white or some combination of the two.
- Polychrom Sync RGB software is not very good IMO. It works but its very slow to startup and once you set the colors I'd just unload the software
- Very expensive for what it is

Overall Review: Ok so lets first address the elephant in the room, this card and all GPU's are massively overpriced in this crypto mining world we live in today. I really held out as long as I could and I landed this card for $1499. This is by far the most expensive card I've ever purchased. I'm upgrading from a EVGA 2080 which I paid roughly $700 for so over double in price and I'm quite certain I'm not getting double the performance. That said, I just wanted to build an all AMD machine and well I paid the piper. Also 6800XT's are going for almost as much and I just figured I'm already spending way more than I want to so I might as well just go all in.

This card is huge and weighs almost 6lbs. The Corsair Crystal 680X was always going to be the case I built this system in and I was shocked when this card barely fit in it. I really thought I would have surplus space given how roomy this case is but wow, another millimeter and I'd be sending this card back. The card has a very slight sag on my Asus TUF Gaming X570 Plus MB. Nothing I'd be too worried about but I may slide a support in there if it kicks off my OCD too much in the future.

The card feels and looks very tough and there is nothing cheap feeling about this card. It is performing very well at 3440x1440 and I'm getting great FPS on all the games I'm playing at Ultra settings. I'd say decent temps as well, I did play with the fan curves a bit but generally its running in the 40's idle and 60's to high 70's during gameplay. I dont have a 4K monitor to test out and I'm really not considering 4K gaming at this point in time. I think 1440p is the sweet spot for gaming right now and this card is almost overkill but what is wrong with that right?

I'm not a fan of the Polychrome Sync software that you use to change the lighting on the card as its very slow and takes forever to start up. Once I have the color set though its easy enough to remove the software. I'm also not a fan of the red highlights on the card, I knew the color-scheme when I bought it but I'd prefer and all black or black and white card.

Overall I think this card is a winner and if you're like me desperately trying to build a new machine in the worst possible market, this card is a fine addition and you shouldn't be worried about its performance. The pricing is insane and I realize I'm contributing to these high prices by purchasing this card but I wanted a new machine and it is what it is. This card would probably retail for around $1200 normally anyway so $300 over is pretty good in this market IMO.",5,12/15/2021,Newegg
ASRock,Radeon RX 6900 XT PHANTOM GAMING,RX 6900,"Pros: Nicer looking

Cons: Too big
Fans are too loud
Less FPS than AMD card

Overall Review: We are now in Sept 2022...I have had my Asrock rx6900 xt oc for 6 months now. Not impressed. Yes, the fans are WAY too loud at just 75%. Yes, you will have to wear an earphone to block 90% of the noise. Thankfully, I do use an earphone for games and that's what I use this card for. Well, as for gaming performance, it's decent. My main game is Warzone and MW19; I get 100-150 fps in Warzone and 150-250 fps in MW19-not overclocked. Don't know why the difference but it is that way. I have a AMD 5950 for cpu. Fast forward to today...I just bought a used AMD RX 6900 XT factory card to use on my Mac for machine learning purpose. (MAC's can use Plaidml and Metal to use external GPU's for training and inference) And latest Apple Metal supports RX6900XT....So, I get my used AMD 6900 and just curious, tried playing Warzone with it. Boy, what a surprise! The AMD factory 6900 smoked Asrock one. I get 150-200 fps in Warzone and 250-300 in MW19 with AMD. Same system and at same in-game settings! And the fans are just barely audible. Even if I did overclock the Asrock, 5-10% improvement is not going to make a huge difference. I am going with founder's/factory cards from now on for both AMD and Nvidia. Just think about it, the engineering staff at AMD and Nvidia probably dwarfs the engineering staffs at the AIB's in terms of quality and quantity. The AIB cards are, in a way,just to market the cards. Very disappointed.",3,10/1/2022,Newegg
ASRock,Radeon RX 6900 XT PHANTOM GAMING,RX 6900,"Pros: - It's a 6900XT with a decent factory OC and performs like one.
- Price wasn't entirely outrageous, given current market realities.
- Negligible PCB warp and no sag, due to being completely encased by an aluminum shroud and backplate.
- Has an actual X-spring holding the cooler to the GPU.
- Newegg's support for issues with my first card was prompt.

Cons: - First sample was unstable and had screaming coil whine.
- Second sample worked well enough, but has a slightly warped heatsink, and still has more coil whine than I'd like.
- Card is physically enormous, with a lot of space taken up by the heatsink shroud.
- Cooling performance is decent, but not as good as it should be for the size of the cooler. Also, the memory/VRM plate is steel, not nickel-plated copper, and the thermal pads on the power regulation barely cover half of each power stage. It's more than sufficient, but still somewhat disappointing.
- The fact that it uses the XTHX silicon is not an advantage for an air cooled part...it mostly just comes with a higher stock voltage that cannot be leveraged without putting the card under water.

Overall Review: At the time of purchase, this card made sense. However, in a more normal market, this doesn't have enough advantages over other 6900 XTs and the 6900 XT doesn't have enough advantages over parts that would normally be considerably cheaper.

ASRock,Radeon RX 6900 XT PHANTOM GAMING,RX 6900,"Pros: - Very powerful card, would be able to handle heavy loads if it didn't crash out due to thermal issues every time I try to exercise it

Cons: - blows up to 110 degrees C almost instantly with heavy load.
- this happens even if you create a custom tune to undervolt and increase the fan speed curve at higher temps
- basically zero thermal management whatsoever, rendering this card useless

- quiet, large fans keep the card cool without sounding like a jet engine

Cons: - huge card, takes up almost 4 slots, covers all but one pci-e x1 slot on my motherboard
- power adapter works but is ugly
- overpriced when compared to AMD cards
- barely fits in a corsair 4000D (but it does!)

Overall Review: Honestly, it's a beast of a card in multiple ways. After not being able to get my hands on a 4090, i figured this would be something i could actually buy. I would definitely buy this card again, even if the ""value"" is better elsewhere, as i had a 2070 super and it was time for an upgrade. It's been quiet, the RGB is tastefull, and it feels good to actually fill out a case with hardware this big. I've been trying all of my most demanding games and have been enjoying the ability to max them all out and not see low frame rates in anything.

GIGABYTE,GIGABYTE Gaming GeForce RTX 4080,RTX 4080,"ros: What isn't there to like from this GPU? It comes with everything right? It's massive. It barely fit in My Corsair iCue 465X. I'd recommend a larger case for this like a Corsair 5000X or bigger. You'll definitely want the extra room. The mounting bracket for this was cake. It works well. When it comes to performance, this was definitely the 2nd fastet GPU money could have bought at the time. My friend asked me, can it play Crysis? Yes. Why yes it can. Probably at 8K too. Most of my games received 200 to 300% performance boost coming from a 2070. It was a big leap.

Cons: This card is massive. It's the biggest GPU I have ever seen. I thought this 2070 was massive. This thing is gargantuan. Power consumption requires at least an 850W PSU. Oh and price. It seems to me that my whole gaming rig from 4 years ago cost as much as this GPU. It's not the 4090. I wanted a 4090 but got tired of waiting for the prices to come down or for it to become available.

Overall Review: I would recommend that people wait for the price to comedown before getting this. If you can get a 4090 at retail, probably just do that. It's not a particular good buy but it's great that you can put one in your cart and get it to your door. With this card being about 73% of the speed of the 4090, It's good enough for government.

GIGABYTE,GIGABYTE Gaming GeForce RTX 4080,RTX 4080,"Overall Review: Building three identical PCs for a scientific application, all with RTX 4080 video cards. One has an Asus card, one has a Gigabyte ""gaming"" 4080, and one has this Gigabyte ""Eagle"" 4080.

No problems with the computers having the Asus or Gigabyte Gaming card, but this card has the same issue that so many others report...card will not work with all three PCIe cables plugged in but works with 2. This has to be some sort of firmware issue with this card...hard to believe for what this card costs that the problem got by QA.

Another problem with both of the Gigabyte cards is with the anti-sag bracket...it's not compatible with eATX motherboards. I had to fabricate custom brackets to keep these behemoths from sagging and eventually breaking the motherboard. To be fair the little support peg Asus included with their card was a joke but the problem with the Gigabyte brackets could easily be fixed with some minor design changes. Also, for reasons that escape me, the part of the bracket that screws onto the cards is different for the ""Gaming"" and ""Eagle"" versions of this card. Seems kinda silly they couldn't design the two cards to use the same bracket.",3,1/13/2023,Newegg
GIGABYTE,GIGABYTE Gaming GeForce RTX 4080,RTX 4080,"Pros: -Good looking card
-Runs very cool thanks to its over sized cooler
-Well thought out support bracket
-Good power to performance

Cons: -The over sized cooler that keeps the cars cool made me have to buy a new case because of power connector clearance
-The cost of the 80 series card (a high end card I thought was supposed to be for the people) is ridiculous
-I said the support bracket was a pro due to its well thought out design, but in reality we need support brackets now? Something doesnt sit right with me

Overall Review: The 4080 is an excellent example of a company with to much power in the market using its pull for greed. Nvidia has priced this card in such a way that they can maximize its profits on 2 year old products due to excessive surplus (3000 series cards). Cards mind you that were being sold off to scalpers and crypto miners instead of getting into the hands of the the core audience and primary buyers gamers. As soon as the crypto bubble popped and it became clear that there would be extra stock on 3000 series parts Nvidia passed the bag to very audience they should of been focusing on this whole time and expected us to fix it for them with hopes of finally being able to buy products at a reasonable price but its not reasonable, the 4080 is proof of that. This card exists (at its current asking price of $1200+ USD) solely to sell old stock while appearing as the shiny new cheaper option. It goes one step further and makes a $1600+ look good with its significantly cut down performance to the 4090. This card exists in my opinion, to sell other cards. The official announcement and pricing of the 4080 12gb (4070ti) is even further proof of how out of touch Nvidia is and how inflated its profits probably are. I can not imagine a time where there were $400 price gaps between card models. This card runs cool, looks great, performs better then the last gens best at significantly lower power draw and I have one in my PC, and you know what I can not feel more indifferent about it. With a $500 price increase over the last gen 80 series I feel like Nvidia has priced themselves out of the market.

ASUS,Gaming NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti,RTX 4070 Ti,"Pros: Very rigid card, no sagging whatsoever. My old gigabyte 3070 required the anti sag that is built into the fractal torrent to stay completely level. This card does not sag but I still use the torrent holder since it is there.

Big difference over my 3070 for 2k gaming. AAA titles at full ultra settings and the card doesnt even break a sweat. Runs surprisingly cool, even with long gaming sessions Ive never seen the card get over 55 c. On performance mode the fans are not noticeably audible, much quieter than my old 3070.

In the market today .. what better choice in the price range is there.

Cons: --LED's are lack luster.. which who cares, but given that the card is GINORMOUS I feel like it would be nice to have a little more.
-- No Waterblock options as of late for this thing. The actual card is small.. Id love to have it waterblocked instead of mounted vertically air cooled in my super custom waterloop RIG, but we'll see I suppose

Overall Review: In the market today .. what better choice in the price range is there. You could get a 3090 maybe that had about the same performance, but actually not quite as good. It beats the 3090ti as well. I guess it depends what you're gonna do with it, but if you game, at 2k, like I do this thing is great. Haven't even had it slow down. I know 800 is a lot for a GPU, but its not over 1000, It beats all the 30 series cards which are still going for close to that.

I dont know all the reviewers, gamers nexus..etc etc.. were quick to bash this GPU and NVidia, and I see why. At the end of the day 800 bucks, this card.. preforms pretty amazing, Short of jumping to a 4080 or a 4090 .. what are you going to do exactly?",5,2/20/2023,Newegg
ASUS,Gaming NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti,RTX 4070 Ti,"Pros: Quiet Fans
Small(er) size, fits in a microATX case
Great packaging
Metal Frame

Cons: Serious coil whine
Terrible value, but that's not the fault of Asus

Overall Review: This card works excellently except for one issue, the coil whine. Benchmarking or playing a game or doing anything that uses the GPU generates crazy awful coil whine. For how much this card cost, it shouldn't have this annoying noise. The other reviews about coil whine are true, I ignored them when purchasing this card.

I'll just deal with the noise, as I don't want to go to the trouble of returning it. Everything else works great and no complaints otherwise. I especially like the size of the card as it fits perfectly in my Silverstone Fara H1M case with a microATX motherboard (Asus TUF B760M). I appreciate that Asus included the GPU support stand and some other nice things in the box. The GPU will probably last forever, the build quality on it is outstanding, all metal!

Compared to other options, this is still most likely the best as the fans and cooler are quiet and efficient. At least the PCB won't crack or deform over time like my previous Gigabyte card.",3,7/18/2023,Newegg

For the price, it's good when it's on-sale, when it's not, you may have better luck with AMD.

Another inconvenience, not really a con, is the GPU support is too long for my mATX case, and it's magnetic, if that worries you.

-Its quiet and never gets to hot which is another awesome aspect.

Cons: -Price on the RTX line up is just to high but when i was aiming to get the 1080ti version to this after the RTX cards came out some 1080ti models jumped up in price.
-The card is thick like almost a 3 slot i wouldnt say its a con but it does take up space and it has some weight on it.

Beside those two above comments its a great card.

Overall Review: If you have a 1080 ti or something close to this i would say hold off. I was building a new workstations/Game station and decided to go with this awesome card. When they annouced it was super excited. The big thing for me was the 7 ports which gives you so much flexibility for your system. Have your monitors and a VR set up. Beside that i would say if you building a fresh system invest in this card. Not sure if there is a Ti version there is a 2070 version around 650 for the extreme and 620 for the norm version like mine. It not a big difference.

GIGABYTE,AORUS GeForce RTX 2080 XTREME WATERFORCE,RTX 2080,"Pros: Editing my review because the unit developed coil whine and fan issues after a couple weeks of use.

Positive; I went from a roaring OC'd 1070ti that could barely pull 120fps to this card doing much more work and only pushing about 55% load during gameplay. The card is such a beast I had to bump my 9600k up to 4.8GHz just so it would catch up. I'm still 50% cpu bound.

Despite the power, it doesn't have horrible energy consumption like the ti version either.

Cons: Annoying coil whine buzz developed. If I use the DP that's next to the hdmi port, the screen cuts out periodically. Also, during idle or low use, the fans click on, then immediately stop. This constant clicking noise sounds like a clock and is obnoxious. There's a strong chance I'll end to returning this card for something else.",3,12/27/2018,Newegg

-RGB Fusion is no good.
-It's long and I had a difficult time fitting it inside the meshify c because of my CPUs 240mm rad so I had to bend the mounting holes in the front of the case so the GPU would actually fit.
-It doesn't stay that cool considering that it has a 240mm AIO, average temps at 2010mghz under full load after an hour is 60c-64c with an ambient room temp of 25c, inside the meshify c with the rad mounted in the front.
-The overall feel of the card and AIO is kinda of cheap considering it costs $900.

Overall Review: -I wish they would use a better quality AIO.
-Shorten the card a bit, 20mm maybe?
-Improve RGB fusion.

GIGABYTE,AORUS GeForce RTX 2080 XTREME WATERFORCE,RTX 2080,"Pros: Runs BFV well, along with Apex Legends

Cons: This thing spikes to 85 C constantly when playing any game that pushes it. I set a custom fan curve and opened my case up and it still revs up incredibly loud every 15 seconds or so as it hits 85C and the fans rev to what seems to be 110% to drop temps down below 80 C..

Oh and this one is my RMA replacement. The first card died one hour after installation.

Overall Review: The temps I get from the ""amazing"" Windforce cooler is ridiculous and I will never buy another gigabyte card. Do not buy unless you enjoy the sound of a jet engine pulsing in your room. My ambient temps are 62 degrees in the house, with plenty of ventilation on the case. I purchased Noctua fans to try and increase the airflow. Opened up the case, manually set all my case fans to 100%. Nothing works.. It's junk do not buy.
