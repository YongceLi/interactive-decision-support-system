Chevrolet,Silverado 3500,"Needed a new truck. I had no intention of buying a heavy-duty vehicle, let alone a Chevrolet. My wife wanted to check out trucks, so I reluctantly agreed. First, we drove some lighter models. Meh. Then she showed me the specs of a Silverado 3500, and I agreed to test drive it. 1. You schedule test drive via online. We found it super convenient. Knew exactly when and where we would be test driving, no waiting in the lot for some pushy salesman. 2. Sign in, Chevrolet rep greets us and lets us look around, then explains to us how to use the features. No sales pushing, just answering all our questions. 3. Supposed to be a 30 min test drive, we couldn't stop, went for an hour. It was thought changing. I went from being a truck skeptic to a Chevrolet enthusiast in 60 min. 4. Went online and bought a truck that afternoon. Again, no scumbag slimy salesman, everything straightforward and easy. 5. Did have to download the app to finish the process to fill out the paperwork. But, this was fine, do it from the living room couch rather than in a crazy office with some sales idiot bugging you to buy some stupid extras. 6. The only hiccup, app prompts you to pay before picking up the truck. I just messaged in the app that I preferred to see the truck before paying. Response, No problem. 7. Pickup fast, efficient, trouble-free. People were great. The whole experience left us thinking, this all works together so well. Everything is well thought out and customer experience well thought out. Truck is just a pleasure to drive. Fun, powerful, quiet, and handles well. Relaxing to drive in traffic. With tax credits, cheaper than a standard pickup. We did get a home charger for the electric version, makes the ownership sooo much better. Just plug it in every night and never worry about range for normal commuting. Day three, first day commuting, we got a weird rock ding and broke the front passenger window. Got home. Called service (they answered fast) and they recommended using the app to schedule service. (They offered to schedule over the phone, but I wanted to try the app). Tried it, flawless to schedule service. Asked you to describe the problem, take some pics and submit. Within minutes, got a message that a mobile appointment was scheduled. App asked for insurance, and that was it. Tech showed up in service time. Fixed the window fast, answered a bunch of questions we had about features, and then was off. No muss, no fuss. Mobile service was AWESOME! Oh, total cost to us was $0. Fit and finish great. Driving in rain great. 500-mile road trip with family of four great. Total cost, $16. Time at charging station, 14 min from 30% to 95%. People complain about no CarPlay/Android Auto, non-issue. Chevrolet navigation is outstanding. Phone Bluetooth connects for calls. Connectivity lets you connect to streaming services you subscribe to. Don't care about CarPlay/Android Auto anymore, it's irrelevant. You do have to take some time to learn how to use everything but it's time well spent as there's sooo much there for you to tailor the truck to how you want things. Chevrolet Silverado 3500.

Ford,Mustang,"Needed a new car. I had no intention of buying a sports coupe, let alone a Ford Mustang. My wife wanted to check out some performance vehicles, so I reluctantly agreed. First, we drove some other coupes. Meh. Then she showed me the price of a Mustang and I agreed to test drive it. 1. You schedule a test drive online. We found it super convenient. Knew exactly when and where we would be test driving, no waiting in a car lot for some pushy salesman. 2. Sign in, Ford rep greets us and lets us look around, then explains to us how to use the features. No sales pushing, just answering all our questions. 3. Supposed to be a 30 min test drive, we couldn't stop, went for an hour. It was thought changing. I went from being a sports car skeptic to a Mustang enthusiast in 60 min. 4. Went online and bought a car that afternoon. Again, no scumbag slimy car salesman, everything straightforward and easy. 5. Did have to download the app to finish the process to fill out the paperwork. But, this was fine, do it from the living room couch rather than in a crazy office with some sales idiot bugging you to buy some stupid extras. 6. The only hiccup, app prompts you to pay before picking up the car. I just messaged in the app that I preferred to see the car before paying. Response, No problem. 7. Pickup was fast, efficient, and trouble-free. People were great. The whole experience left us thinking, this all works together so well. Everything is well thought out and customer experience is well considered. The car is just a pleasure to drive. Fun, fast, quiet, handles well. Relaxing to drive in traffic. With tax credits, cheaper than a standard sedan. We did get a home charger, makes the ownership sooo much better. Just plug it in every night and never worry about range for normal commuting.

Ram,1500 Crew Cab,"I purchased the Ram 1500 Crew Cab with the 3.6-liter V6. Everything started off great. I bought the truck because my previous vehicle was getting a lot of miles and having issues. Needed something reliable. On my way home from work, I stopped at the grocery store, and when I was ready to leave, I turned the key, and it wouldn't start or even crank at all. My display was showing multiple faults like brakes, camera, blind spot lights, among many other faults. The brake lights came on and wouldn't shut off until the battery went completely dead. It was 7pm. I went to the Ram app and ordered a tow truck, which did not arrive. By 1am, I tried calling the tow truck company, and they never answered. I called AAA, which I should have done to begin with, and even they didn't show up until 6am. I sat in my truck for 11 hours in the grocery store parking lot, totally stranded. By 8am, I called the Ram dealer to get a tow truck to my house and was furious by that point. A tow truck arrived a couple of hours later to take the truck to the dealer I bought it from. The dealer tells me there's 35 vehicles ahead of me waiting for service, and it will be a while before they could even look at my truck. It's been 5 days, and they still haven't looked at it. The day I bought the truck, the salesperson told me I wouldn't have any problems, but if I did, they would take care of me immediately. So glad I didn't trade in my previous vehicle because I'm self-employed and would be losing a lot of money and business.

The carpet is embarrassingly low quality, and the trunk is poorly designed, with no molded lining to organize the space. To make matters worse, the tailgate doesn't even open with the remote—something that should be standard in any modern car. The infotainment system is laughably basic, with very few features for a car at this price point.

If I'm going to buy foreign, I might as well choose a car with proven longevity. Not only that, the 2025 Jetta is made in Mexico, which is a nice touch. The restyling of the Jetta is eye-catching. I opted for the pure white color with a black interior. I have yet to open the panoramic sunroof (probably never will). The instrumentation panel is very interactive and pretty easy to use while driving. Our previous SUV was typical of its class—noisy. But this Jetta made me understand why so many people are loyal to Volkswagen. It drives exceptionally well. In cruise mode, it handles all the safety features seamlessly, including braking and lane departure. Getting in is no problem, but getting out reminds me I need to lose a pound and wish I was 10 years younger. Great car, and I wish GM had a hybrid.

Subaru,Crosstrek,"I had a 2015 Subaru Outback and after 75K miles, it finally let me down while towing a 2,500 lb camper, and it was going to be at least a week as no one could figure out what was wrong. Well, they still offered me over 5,000 bucks more than a year ago on a trade, and this new Crosstrek was sitting there at a price right in line with what I bought six years ago for financing. So, what has changed in five years? Well, it’s a bit more refined. I didn't know that but I feel it every time I drive it. There are definitely more features for sure. So, what stands out? It is the comfortable feel of this compact SUV. I mean, it is so smooth driving it, it's amazing. It is quiet inside, and my dogs love the back with their extra space when the seats are up out of the way. The Crosstrek is NOT my daily driver anymore and is mostly dedicated to light towing and some light off-roading in interesting places here in Montana. It certainly has the capabilities to do that, so now it is just seeing how it does over time. First impressions are a highly refined but still rugged vehicle. I got it to tow and it has the tow package. THAT I like, including the trailer TPMS monitor. The extra storage features I didn't really want were the roof rails and the new hatch design. OK, two weeks into it and I am really starting to like them. The roof rails are useful and for my needs, don't get in the way of space inside. AND, going to the transfer station I can open the hatch and reach everything easily instead of having to stretch to get stuff. OH, get the premium light package period. The LED headlights are worth their weight in gold compared to the old ones. Make that a must. But if gas mileage is a problem for you? Get a different vehicle. Well, I got rid of the Outback. Not because I had a problem as such, but because it didn’t tow my 3,000 lb camper as well as I needed. I bought a ""22"" Crosstrek in the same color and love it. So, IF you do NOT tow over 3,000 lbs, I would actually go for a Crosstrek over a larger SUV. The Crosstrek in the Premium trim and up is essentially a comfortable daily driver with some very good capabilities for light towing...up to around 3K in perfect comfort. The ride vs a larger SUV is amazing. The larger SUVs are trucks and ride like trucks. They have the comfortable interior but less room in the back as my dogs will attest to. I loved my Outbacks, both of them, but IF you are going to tow and generally go above 3K on your trailer, you might want to consider a larger SUV.

Chevrolet,Silverado 2500HD,"I had a 2015 Outdoorsman with a winch and aftermarket rear bumper. It went 75K miles for me and then finally let me down while towing a 6500 lb travel trailer, and it was going to be at least a week or two as no one could figure out what was wrong. Well, they still offered me over 5,000 bucks more than a year ago on a trade, and this new ""High Country"" edition was sitting there, with the final price right at what I bought six years ago for financing. So, what has changed in five years? Well, it’s four inches longer. I didn't know that but do every time I try to park it. There are more bells and whistles for sure. So, here at first what stands out? It is the luxurious feel of this truck. I mean, it is so smooth driving it; it’s amazing. It is quiet inside, and the dogs love the back with their extra four inches of space with the seats up out of the way. The truck is NOT my daily driver anymore and is mostly dedicated to towing the trailer and going to the transfer station and some light off-roading in interesting places here in Montana. It certainly has the equipment to do that, so now it is just seeing how it does over time. First impressions are a highly refined but still assuredly a beast. I got it to tow, and it has the tow package. THAT I like, including the trailer TPMS monitor. The sleeper package I didn't really want was the in-bed storage compartments and the new ""barn door"" tailgate. OK, two weeks into it, and I am really starting to like them. The storage compartments are huge and FOR MY NEEDS, don't get in the way of space in the bed. AND, going to the transfer station, I open the doors and not the ""tailgate"" and can reach everything instead of having to throw half my body on the tailgate to reach stuff. OH, get the premium light package, period. The LED headlights are worth their weight in gold compared to the old ones. Make that a must. But if gas mileage is a problem for you? Get a Prius. Well, I got rid of the 1500. Not because I had a problem as such, but because it didn't tow my 6700 lb travel trailer as good as I needed. I bought a ""22"" 2500 in the same color and love it.

Toyota,Camry,"I had a 2015 Corolla with a few upgrades, and it went 75K miles for me before I decided it was time for a change.

So, what has changed in five years? Well, it feels more refined and spacious. I didn't know that, but I notice it every time I get in. There are definitely more features now. 

What stands out initially? It’s the luxurious feel of this sedan. I mean, it drives so smoothly it’s amazing. It’s quiet inside, and the extra space in the back seat is great for passengers. The Camry is NOT my daily driver anymore; it’s mostly dedicated to commuting and some longer trips around Montana. It certainly has the comfort and capability for that, so now it’s just about how it holds up over time. First impressions are of a highly refined vehicle that still feels sporty. 

I got it for the features, and it has the tech package. THAT I like, including the advanced safety features.

Dodge,Durango,"Due to age and mileage, I needed to replace my wife's Mercedes R500, which has served us very well for dog hauling, long-distance family trips, and daily use over 90K miles, as well as my S430, which has been a great mile-eater but not used enough. With the nearest MB dealer 90 miles away, and the local indie mech crazy busy, changing brands was a necessity. After searching for a replacement for over a year and driving 20+ cars, the best choice to meet our needs was a 2026 Dodge Durango. It finally arrived last week, and the 2-for-1 deal was concluded with no hassle. I'm a car guy, mostly European sports and luxury, and I have to say the newest Dodge Durango is as competent as any MB, Saab, or BMW I've owned at a bargain price (for what it offers). Roomy, great seats, beautiful finishes, and so far impressive fuel efficiency. It's quieter than my S-class, as roomy as you can get in such a small footprint, and with tech and customization of features and drive modes as you can get. I hate CVTs - so the 8-speed automatic transmission (plus the available hybrid option) is great. Selectable regen is a plus (although when the smallish battery is charged it shuts off). The factory tires aren't the best, but they do seem to boost mileage - we'll see how they do in snow. Steering is light and precise - and road manners are excellent. Brakes are good. Visibility is excellent. The Durango's power is good for most situations - zippy around town, and easy passes on the highway. I'm surprised at how much the vehicle drives on electric power alone - with a very smooth transition to the gas engine. The new dash and instrument display is elegant and works great.
