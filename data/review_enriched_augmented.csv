Chevrolet,Silverado 3500,"Needed a new truck. I had no intention of buying a heavy-duty vehicle, let alone a Chevrolet. My wife wanted to check out trucks, so I reluctantly agreed. First, we drove some lighter models. Meh. Then she showed me the specs of a Silverado 3500, and I agreed to test drive it. 1. You schedule test drive via online. We found it super convenient. Knew exactly when and where we would be test driving, no waiting in the lot for some pushy salesman. 2. Sign in, Chevrolet rep greets us and lets us look around, then explains to us how to use the features. No sales pushing, just answering all our questions. 3. Supposed to be a 30 min test drive, we couldn't stop, went for an hour. It was thought changing. I went from being a truck skeptic to a Chevrolet enthusiast in 60 min. 4. Went online and bought a truck that afternoon. Again, no scumbag slimy salesman, everything straightforward and easy. 5. Did have to download the app to finish the process to fill out the paperwork. But, this was fine, do it from the living room couch rather than in a crazy office with some sales idiot bugging you to buy some stupid extras. 6. The only hiccup, app prompts you to pay before picking up the truck. I just messaged in the app that I preferred to see the truck before paying. Response, No problem. 7. Pickup fast, efficient, trouble-free. People were great. The whole experience left us thinking, this all works together so well. Everything is well thought out and customer experience well thought out. Truck is just a pleasure to drive. Fun, powerful, quiet, and handles well. Relaxing to drive in traffic. With tax credits, cheaper than a standard pickup. We did get a home charger for the electric version, makes the ownership sooo much better. Just plug it in every night and never worry about range for normal commuting. Day three, first day commuting, we got a weird rock ding and broke the front passenger window. Got home. Called service (they answered fast) and they recommended using the app to schedule service. (They offered to schedule over the phone, but I wanted to try the app). Tried it, flawless to schedule service. Asked you to describe the problem, take some pics and submit. Within minutes, got a message that a mobile appointment was scheduled. App asked for insurance, and that was it. Tech showed up in service time. Fixed the window fast, answered a bunch of questions we had about features, and then was off. No muss, no fuss. Mobile service was AWESOME! Oh, total cost to us was $0. Fit and finish great. Driving in rain great. 500-mile road trip with family of four great. Total cost, $16. Time at charging station, 14 min from 30% to 95%. People complain about no CarPlay/Android Auto, non-issue. Chevrolet navigation is outstanding. Phone Bluetooth connects for calls. Connectivity lets you connect to streaming services you subscribe to. Don't care about CarPlay/Android Auto anymore, it's irrelevant.

Pickup was fast, efficient, trouble-free. People were great. The whole experience left us thinking, this all works together so well. Everything is well thought out and customer experience well considered. The car is just a pleasure to drive. Fun, rugged, quiet, fast, handles well off-road. Relaxing to drive in traffic. With tax credits, cheaper than a standard SUV. We did get a home charger, which makes the ownership sooo much better. Just plug it in every night and never worry about range for normal commuting.

Ford,Explorer,"Needed a new car. I had no intention of buying an SUV, let alone a Ford. My wife wanted to check out SUVs, so I reluctantly agreed. First, we drove some compact crossovers. Meh. Then she showed me the price of an Explorer and I agreed to test drive it. 1. You schedule a test drive via online. We found it super convenient. Knew exactly when and where we would be test driving, no waiting in the dealership for some pushy salesman. 2. Sign in, Ford rep greets us and lets us look around, then explains to us how to use the features. No sales pushing, just answering all our questions. 3. Supposed to be a 30 min test drive, we couldn't stop, went for an hour. It was thought-changing. I went from being an SUV skeptic to a Ford enthusiast in 60 min. 4. Went online and bought a car that afternoon. Again, no scumbag slimy car salesman, everything straightforward and easy. 5. Did have to download the app to finish the process to fill out the paperwork.

Acura,TL,"I bought the 2026 Acura TL Hybrid Sport just two days ago, and I'm already extremely frustrated. Before this, I owned a 2017 Ford Explorer Limited, and the difference in quality is simply shocking. The TL's interior feels rushed and careless: cheap, rough plastics, poorly cut panels with even sharp edges. The lower dashboard is so thin and flimsy it feels like it could break with a light touch. The carpet is embarrassingly low quality, and the trunk is poorly designed, with no molded lining to organize the space. To make matters worse, the tailgate doesn't even open with the remote—something that should be standard in any modern car. The infotainment system is laughably basic, with very few features for a car at this price point. The USB ports are outdated and slow—and in 2026, not including a fast-charging USB-C is downright ridiculous. On top of that, there are no parking sensors, neither front nor rear, a feature that has become standard even in much cheaper vehicles. For nearly $40,000, the least you expect is quality and attention to detail. Instead, it feels like Acura only cared about cutting costs to increase profit.

Chevrolet,Colorado,"I've owned this Chevrolet Colorado for nearly 4 months and initially had no issues. In the past month, I've encountered numerous problems related to the electronics and many of the vehicle's features associated with them. Specifically: Dashboard displays blank out or change to other screens without any input from me. The Lane Departure Assist was deactivated twice and turned itself back on both times after a period of weeks. I hate this feature and finding it back on was frustrating. The seat slide and driver's seat programming have stopped functioning repeatedly. While driving on the highway, Cruise Control has activated without any action on my part, which scared me when the vehicle suddenly accelerated in heavy traffic. Apple CarPlay keeps disconnecting, and I have to reconnect it manually. All of my radio presets have erased and had to be reset, which is not easy in this vehicle. Frequently, the truck does not recognize me as the driver (I think it links with my phone) and thinks I am a guest driver.

Subaru,Crosstrek,"I had a 2015 Subaru Outback and after 75K miles, it finally let me down while towing a 2,500 lb camper, and it was going to be at least a week as no one could figure out what was wrong. Well, they still offered me over 5,000 bucks more than a year ago on a trade, and this new Crosstrek was sitting there at a price right in line with what I bought six years ago for financing. So, what has changed in five years? Well, it’s a bit more refined. I didn't know that but I feel it every time I drive it. There are definitely more features for sure. So, what stands out? It is the comfortable feel of this compact SUV. I mean, it is so smooth driving it, it's amazing. It is quiet inside, and my dogs love the back with their extra space when the seats are up out of the way. The Crosstrek is NOT my daily driver anymore and is mostly dedicated to light towing and some light off-roading in interesting places here in Montana. It certainly has the capabilities to do that, so now it is just seeing how it does over time. First impressions are a highly refined but still rugged vehicle. I got it to tow and it has the tow package. THAT I like, including the trailer TPMS monitor. The extra storage features I didn't really want were the roof rails and the new hatch design. OK, two weeks into it and I am really starting to like them. The roof rails are useful and for my needs, don't get in the way of space inside. AND, going to the transfer station I can open the hatch and reach everything easily instead of having to stretch to get stuff. OH, get the premium light package period. The LED headlights are worth their weight in gold compared to the old ones. Make that a must. But if gas mileage is a problem for you? Get a different vehicle. Well, I got rid of the Outback. Not because I had a problem as such, but because it didn’t tow my 3,000 lb camper as well as I needed. I bought a ""22"" Crosstrek in the same color and love it. So, IF you do NOT tow over 3,000 lbs, I would actually go for a Crosstrek over a larger SUV. The Crosstrek in the Premium trim and up is essentially a comfortable daily driver with some very good capabilities for light towing...up to around 3K in perfect comfort. The ride vs a larger SUV is amazing. The larger SUVs are trucks and ride like trucks. They have the comfortable interior but less room in the back as my dogs will attest to. I loved my Outbacks, both of them, but IF you are going to tow and generally go above 3K on your trailer, you might want to consider a larger SUV. It is a completely different ""towing"" experience...in a good way. A larger SUV will be more ""planted"" and less subject to the wind.

AND, going to the transfer station, I open the doors and not the ""tailgate,"" and can reach everything instead of having to throw half my body on the tailgate to reach stuff. OH, get the premium light package, period. The LED headlights are worth their weight in gold compared to the old ones. Make that a must. But if gas mileage is a problem for you? Get a Prius. Well, I got rid of the Silverado. Not because I had a problem as such, but because it didn't tow my 6700 lb travel trailer as good as I needed. I bought a ""22"" 2500 in the same color and love it. So, IF you do NOT tow over 6000 lbs, I would actually go for a Silverado 1500 over a 2500. The Gen 5 Silverado 1500 in a LT trim and up is essentially a luxury daily driver with some very good capabilities for towing...up to around 6K in perfect comfort. The ride vs a 2500 is amazing. The 2500 is a truck and rides like a truck. It has the luxurious interior but less room in the cab, as the dogs will attest to. I loved my Silverados, all three of them, but IF you are going to tow and generally go above 6K on your trailer and above 25 feet, you might want to consider a 2500. It is a completely different ""towing"" experience...in a good way. A 2500 will be more ""planted"" and less subject to the wind. A Silverado 1500 never lets you forget you are towing...something that big... A 2500 gives you a bit more peace of mind and less stress...

Toyota,Camry,"I had a 2015 Corolla with a few upgrades, and it went 75K miles for me before I decided it was time for a change. Well, they offered me over 5,000 bucks more than a year ago on a trade, and this new ""XSE"" edition was sitting there with a price that was right in line with what I paid six years ago. So, what has changed in five years? Well, it feels more refined and spacious. I didn't know that, but I notice it every time I get in. There are definitely more features now. 

What stands out initially? It’s the luxurious feel of this sedan. I mean, it drives so smoothly it’s amazing. It’s quiet inside, and the extra space in the back seat is great for passengers. The Camry is NOT my daily driver anymore; it’s mostly dedicated to commuting and some longer trips around Montana. It certainly has the comfort and capability for that, so now it’s just about how it holds up over time. First impressions are of a highly refined vehicle that still feels sporty. 

I got it for the features, and it has the tech package. THAT I like, including the advanced safety features. The convenience package I didn’t really want was the wireless charging and the new infotainment system. OK, two weeks into it, and I am really starting to appreciate them. The wireless charging is handy, and I can access everything on the infotainment without having to fumble around. Oh, get the premium sound system, period. The audio quality is worth it compared to the old setup. Make that a must. 

But if fuel efficiency is a problem for you? Maybe consider something else. Well, I got rid of the Corolla. Not because I had a problem, but because I wanted something with a bit more space for road trips. I bought a ""22"" RAV4 in the same color and love it. So, IF you do NOT need that extra space, I would actually go for a Camry over an SUV. The Gen 8 Camry in an XSE trim is essentially a luxury daily driver with some very good capabilities for comfort and efficiency. The ride compared to an SUV is amazing. The SUV feels bulkier and rides like one. It has a nice interior but less sporty feel as the passengers will attest to. I loved my Corolla, but IF you are looking for a comfortable commuter with a bit of style, the Camry is a great choice. It offers a more engaging driving experience...in a good way.

Toyota,Corolla,"We’ve had the car now for almost a year. Very pleased with the vehicle, less so with the dealer. No maintenance issues after about five thousand miles. The handling, acceleration, and technology are superb. It takes a while to learn the tech but that's true of ALL new vehicles. Most of it is pretty logical. A couple of minor nits: some glare from the driver's upper air vent reflecting into the side mirror should use black rather than silver. Too many button pushes instead of knobs for heat and air. The garage door refuses to pair with our opener; had no trouble with 6 other cars. The car DOES run fine on regular and despite the howls from the purists, it states right in the manual that using regular gas WILL NOT hurt the engine. Fuel mileage is outstanding for a vehicle of this weight and performance; I routinely get 32 mpg, even in traffic. Quiet and reliable. The dealership experience, however, both in purchase and in routine service leaves much to be desired. Toyota apparently only allows one dealer per midsized city and they can pretty much do as they please regarding add-ons and junk fees. I negotiated to get my price but it wasn't pleasant. They insisted on 5-star reviews when the delivery for a compact vehicle was 3.5 stars, maybe. The salesperson was upset when I gave them an honest review.

Ford,F150 SuperCrew Cab,"We've had the truck now for almost a year. Very pleased with the vehicle, less so with the dealer. No maintenance issues after about five thousand miles. The handling, acceleration, and technology are superb. It takes a while to learn the tech but that's true of ALL new vehicles. Most of it is pretty logical. A couple of minor nits: some glare from the driver's upper air vent reflecting into the side mirror should use black rather than silver. Too many button pushes instead of knobs for heat and air. The garage door refuses to pair with our opener; had no trouble with 6 other trucks. The truck DOES run fine on regular and despite the howls from the purists, it states right in the manual that using regular gas WILL NOT hurt the engine. Fuel mileage is outstanding for a vehicle of this weight and performance; I routinely get 28 mpg, even in traffic. Quiet and elegant.

Dodge,Durango,"Due to age and mileage, I needed to replace my wife's Mercedes R500, which has served us very well for dog hauling, long-distance family trips, and daily use over 90K miles, as well as my S430, which has been a great mile-eater but not used enough. With the nearest MB dealer 90 miles away, and the local indie mech crazy busy, changing brands was a necessity. After searching for a replacement for over a year and driving 20+ cars, the best choice to meet our needs was a 2026 Dodge Durango. It finally arrived last week, and the 2-for-1 deal was concluded with no hassle. I'm a car guy, mostly European sports and luxury, and I have to say the newest Dodge Durango is as competent as any MB, Saab, or BMW I've owned at a bargain price (for what it offers). Roomy, great seats, beautiful finishes, and so far impressive fuel efficiency. It's quieter than my S-class, as roomy as you can get in such a small footprint, and with tech and customization of features and drive modes as you can get. I hate CVTs - so the 8-speed automatic transmission (plus the available hybrid option) is great. Selectable regen is a plus (although when the smallish battery is charged it shuts off). The factory tires aren't the best, but they do seem to boost mileage - we'll see how they do in snow. Steering is light and precise - and road manners are excellent. Brakes are good. Visibility is excellent. The Durango's power is good for most situations - zippy around town, and easy passes on the highway. I'm surprised at how much the vehicle drives on electric power alone - with a very smooth transition to the gas engine. The new dash and instrument display is elegant and works great.
