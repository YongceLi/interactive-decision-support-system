Ford,Transit Cargo Van,2025,"Just bought a 2025 Transit Cargo Van and it broke down at 20 miles. It had 8 miles on it when I got it and I drove it a whole 12. It's a cheap novelty imo.

Ford,F-350,2026,"Waited two years on a waiting list and ended up with the F-350 Lariat with the 6.7L Power Stroke Diesel. Original order was for a Limited Edition, and when we were told the features would be delayed due to manufacturing issues, we changed to the combination above. Was completely blown away at the ride and handling versus our previous heavy-duty truck. Still love that truck, but the F-350 is so much more refined for both on and off-road use. The spaciousness of the cabin versus the other truck was a great surprise as well. Had the typical first year production gremlins that I've experienced in Asian, German, and American vehicles we were early adopters of; comes with the territory and Ford stayed in touch and took care of them as they came up. Never driven anything outside of a military HUMMV that was this confidence-inspiring off-road, towing heavy loads with ease, I mean at the turn of a dial all the towing modes did what was asked of them. Interior noise shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who's owned a heavy-duty truck. Interior materials and drain holes for rinsing out dirt and debris were great. I would love it if Ford made a solid one-piece body like the Ram. No regrets at all. *Edmunds doesn't have the Lariat with the 6.7L Diesel, but that was our combination so maybe they can fix that.",5,2/5/2024,LLM,LLM
Jeep,Grand Cherokee L,2026,"Waited two years on a waiting list and ended up with the Grand Cherokee L with the 5.7L V8. Originally ordered a different trim but when we learned about some delays, we switched to this combination. I was completely blown away by the ride and handling compared to our previous SUV. Still love our old vehicle, but the Grand Cherokee L is so much more refined for both on and off-road use. The spaciousness of the interior and the comfort of the seating was a great surprise as well. Had the typical first year production gremlins that I've experienced in various vehicles we've owned; comes with the territory, but Jeep stayed in touch and took care of them as they arose. I've never driven anything outside of a military HUMMV that was this confidence-inspiring off-road, in the water, or while towing; the various terrain modes did exactly what was needed with just a turn of a dial. Interior noise shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who's owned an SUV with a panoramic roof. The interior materials and the thoughtful design for easy cleaning were impressive. I would love it if Jeep made a solid one-piece body like some luxury brands. No regrets at all.",5,2/5/2024,LLM,LLM
Toyota,Highlander,2026,"Waited two years on a waiting list and ended up with the Highlander XSE with the 3.5L V6. Originally ordered a Limited trim, but when we were informed that some features would not be available due to manufacturing issues, we switched to the combination above. Was completely blown away at the ride and handling compared to our previous SUV. Still love our old vehicle, but the Highlander is so much more refined for both on and off-road use. The spaciousness of the cabin versus our previous SUV was a great surprise as well. Had the typical first year production quirks that I've experienced in various vehicles we've owned; comes with the territory, and Toyota stayed in touch and took care of them as they came up. Never driven anything outside of a military HUMMV that was this confidence-inspiring off-road, in the water, or when launching jet skis with no boat ramp; at the turn of a dial, all the drive modes performed flawlessly. Interior noise shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who's owned an SUV with a soft top. The interior materials and drainage solutions for rinsing out sand and mud were excellent.

Ford,Bronco,2026,"Waited two years on a waiting list and ended up with the Outer Banks and 2.7 with Soft Top. Original Order was for a First Edition and when we were told the Top would not be molded in color due to manufacturing issues, we changed from the limited production First Edition to the combination above. Was completely blown away at the ride and handling versus our Wrangler. Still love the Wrangler, but the Bronco is so much more refined from both on and off road use.

Chevrolet,Silverado 3500,2023,"Needed a new truck. I had no intention of buying a heavy-duty vehicle, let alone a Chevrolet. My wife wanted to check out trucks, so I reluctantly agreed. First, we drove some lighter models. Meh. Then she showed me the specs of a Silverado 3500, and I agreed to test drive it. 1. You schedule test drive via online. We found it super convenient. Knew exactly when and where we would be test driving, no waiting in the lot for some pushy salesman. 2. Sign in, Chevrolet rep greets us and lets us look around, then explains to us how to use the features. No sales pushing, just answering all our questions. 3. Supposed to be a 30 min test drive, we couldn't stop, went for an hour. It was thought changing. I went from being a truck skeptic to a Chevrolet enthusiast in 60 min. 4. Went online and bought a truck that afternoon. Again, no scumbag slimy salesman, everything straightforward and easy. 5. Did have to download the app to finish the process to fill out the paperwork. But, this was fine, do it from the living room couch rather than in a crazy office with some sales idiot bugging you to buy some stupid extras. 6. The only hiccup, app prompts you to pay before picking up the truck. I just messaged in the app that I preferred to see the truck before paying. Response, No problem. 7. Pickup fast, efficient, trouble-free. People were great. The whole experience left us thinking, this all works together so well. Everything is well thought out and customer experience well thought out. Truck is just a pleasure to drive. Fun, powerful, quiet, and handles well. Relaxing to drive in traffic. With tax credits, cheaper than a standard pickup. We did get a home charger for the electric version, makes the ownership sooo much better. Just plug it in every night and never worry about range for normal commuting. Day three, first day commuting, we got a weird rock ding and broke the front passenger window. Got home. Called service (they answered fast) and they recommended using the app to schedule service. (They offered to schedule over the phone, but I wanted to try the app). Tried it, flawless to schedule service. Asked you to describe the problem, take some pics and submit. Within minutes, got a message that a mobile appointment was scheduled. App asked for insurance, and that was it. Tech showed up in service time. Fixed the window fast, answered a bunch of questions we had about features, and then was off. No muss, no fuss. Mobile service was AWESOME! Oh, total cost to us was $0. Fit and finish great. Driving in rain great. 500-mile road trip with family of four great. Total cost, $16. Time at charging station, 14 min from 30% to 95%. People complain about no CarPlay/Android Auto, non-issue. Chevrolet navigation is outstanding. Phone Bluetooth connects for calls. Connectivity lets you connect to streaming services you subscribe to. Don't care about CarPlay/Android Auto anymore, it's irrelevant. You do have to take some time to learn how to use everything but it's time well spent as there's sooo much there for you to tailor the truck to how you want things. Chevrolet Silverado 3500. Two months, 2000 miles. Loving it. Can't wait for our other vehicle to have an issue, so we can justify getting another Silverado.",5,9/28/2023,LLM,LLM

Chevrolet,Colorado,2024,"I purchased the Chevrolet Colorado single cab with an extended bed, & the 2.7 liter 6 cylinder. Everything was great.

It was 7pm. I went to the Chevrolet app & ordered a tow truck which did not arrive. By 1am I tried calling the tow truck company & they never answered. I called AAA which I should have done to begin with & even they didn't show up until 6am. I sat in my truck for 11 hrs in the grocery store parking lot totally stranded. By 8am I called the Chevrolet dealer to get a tow truck to my house & was furious by that point. A tow truck arrived a couple hours later to take the truck to the dealer I bought it from.

My display was showing multiple faults like brakes, camera, blind spot lights, among many other faults. The brake lights came on and wouldn't shut off until the battery went completely dead. It was 7pm. I went to the Ram app and ordered a tow truck, which did not arrive. By 1am, I tried calling the tow truck company, and they never answered. I called AAA, which I should have done to begin with, and even they didn't show up until 6am. I sat in my truck for 11 hours in the grocery store parking lot, totally stranded. By 8am, I called the Ram dealer to get a tow truck to my house and was furious by that point. A tow truck arrived a couple of hours later to take the truck to the dealer I bought it from. The dealer tells me there's 35 vehicles ahead of me waiting for service, and it will be a while before they could even look at my truck. It's been 5 days, and they still haven't looked at it. The day I bought the truck, the salesperson told me I wouldn't have any problems, but if I did, they would take care of me immediately. So glad I didn't trade in my previous vehicle because I'm self-employed and would be losing a lot of money and business. I bought my 2024 Ram 1500 just 6 weeks ago, and it's already broken down and unusable! Here I am paying for a brand new truck I can't even use! Wishing now that I never would have bought it!! Total let down!!",2,8/19/2024,LLM,LLM

Chevrolet,Colorado,2026,"Having owned multiple Colorado models, I've observed a significant improvement in cabin noise reduction compared to earlier iterations, particularly when the bed is open during operation. Furthermore, the headrest design has been enhanced, providing a more comfortable and ergonomic experience compared to previous versions. Upon Bluetooth connection, the current device does not exhibit the multiple connection attempts observed in the previous model. The inclusion of reclining rear seats is a thoughtful feature, and it would have been particularly appreciated during trips when the kids were younger. The vehicle's automatic engine stop-start system, which activates upon brake application, is a feature I find undesirable, despite the option to disable it. The vehicle lacks fog lights. A cargo cover isn't included. Furthermore, the gap is not concealed when the rear seats are in an upright position. It appears that SiriusXM is no longer available as a direct option, and the only way to access it is through streaming. Consequently, my spouse now needs to use a charger or Bluetooth to listen to something other than the radio while driving.

Before this, I owned a 2017 Ford Explorer Limited, and the difference in quality is simply shocking.

The carpet is embarrassingly low quality, and the trunk is poorly designed, with no molded lining to organize the space. To make matters worse, the tailgate doesn't even open with the remote—something that should be standard in any modern car. The infotainment system is laughably basic, with very few features for a car at this price point. The USB ports are outdated and slow—and in 2026, not including a fast-charging USB-C is downright ridiculous. On top of that, there are no parking sensors, neither front nor rear, a feature that has become standard even in much cheaper vehicles.

Jeep,Grand Wagoneer,2025,"I've owned this Jeep Grand Wagoneer for nearly 4 months and initially had no issues. In the past month, I've encountered numerous problems related to the electronics and many of the vehicle's features associated with them. Specifically: Dashboard displays blank out or change to other screens without any input from me. The Lane Departure Assist was deactivated twice and turned itself back on both times after a period of weeks. I hate this feature and finding it back on... I was not pleased. The seat slide and driver's seat programming have stopped functioning, repeatedly. While driving on the highway, Cruise Control has turned on without any action on my part. It scared the crap out of me when the vehicle suddenly accelerated in heavy traffic. Apple CarPlay keeps disconnecting, and I have to reconnect it manually. All of my radio presets have erased and had to be reset - which is not easy in this vehicle. Frequently, the car does not recognize me as the driver (I think it links with my phone) and thinks I am a guest driver. The last time was when I took it to a carwash and someone else drove it in and out of the tunnel. When I got in, much of my programming was gone. It has TOO MANY features, and they are highly distracting. This is my 3rd Jeep, and I liked my previous models much better. I wish I'd kept my last one.",2,10/19/2024,LLM,LLM

Subaru,Crosstrek,2021,"I had a 2015 Subaru Outback and after 75K miles, it finally let me down while towing a 2,500 lb camper, and it was going to be at least a week as no one could figure out what was wrong. Well, they still offered me over 5,000 bucks more than a year ago on a trade, and this new Crosstrek was sitting there at a price right in line with what I bought six years ago for financing. So, what has changed in five years? Well, it’s a bit more refined. I didn't know that but I feel it every time I drive it. There are definitely more features for sure. So, what stands out? It is the comfortable feel of this compact SUV. I mean, it is so smooth driving it, it's amazing. It is quiet inside, and my dogs love the back with their extra space when the seats are up out of the way. The Crosstrek is NOT my daily driver anymore and is mostly dedicated to light towing and some light off-roading in interesting places here in Montana. It certainly has the capabilities to do that, so now it is just seeing how it does over time. First impressions are a highly refined but still rugged vehicle. I got it to tow and it has the tow package. THAT I like, including the trailer TPMS monitor. The extra storage features I didn't really want were the roof rails and the new hatch design. OK, two weeks into it and I am really starting to like them. The roof rails are useful and for my needs, don't get in the way of space inside. AND, going to the transfer station I can open the hatch and reach everything easily instead of having to stretch to get stuff. OH, get the premium light package period. The LED headlights are worth their weight in gold compared to the old ones. Make that a must. But if gas mileage is a problem for you? Get a different vehicle. Well, I got rid of the Outback. Not because I had a problem as such, but because it didn’t tow my 3,000 lb camper as well as I needed. I bought a ""22"" Crosstrek in the same color and love it. So, IF you do NOT tow over 3,000 lbs, I would actually go for a Crosstrek over a larger SUV. The Crosstrek in the Premium trim and up is essentially a comfortable daily driver with some very good capabilities for light towing...up to around 3K in perfect comfort. The ride vs a larger SUV is amazing. The larger SUVs are trucks and ride like trucks. They have the comfortable interior but less room in the back as my dogs will attest to. I loved my Outbacks, both of them, but IF you are going to tow and generally go above 3K on your trailer, you might want to consider a larger SUV. It is a completely different ""towing"" experience...in a good way. A larger SUV will be more ""planted"" and less subject to the wind. A Crosstrek never lets you forget you are towing...something that big... A larger SUV gives you a bit more peace of mind and less stress...

The SUV is NOT my daily driver anymore and is mostly dedicated to towing the trailer and going to the transfer station and some light off-roading in interesting places here in Montana. It certainly has the equipment to do that, so now it is just seeing how it does over time. First impressions are a highly refined but still assuredly a beast. I got it to tow, and it has the tow package. THAT I like, including the trailer TPMS monitor. The sleeper package I didn't really want was the cargo management system and the new tailgate design. OK, two weeks into it, and I am really starting to like them. The cargo management system is huge and FOR MY NEEDS, doesn't get in the way of space in the back. AND, going to the transfer station, I open the doors and not the tailgate and can reach everything instead of having to throw half my body on the tailgate to reach stuff. OH, get the premium light package, period. The LED headlights are worth their weight in gold compared to the old ones. Make that a must. But if gas mileage is a problem for you? Get a Prius. Well, I got rid of the Explorer. Not because I had a problem as such, but because it didn't tow my 6700 lb travel trailer as good as I needed. I bought a ""22"" Expedition in the same color and love it. So, IF you do NOT tow over 6000 lbs, I would actually go for an Expedition over a larger SUV. The Gen 5 Expedition in a Timberline trim and up is essentially a luxury daily driver with some very good capabilities for towing...up to around 6K in perfect comfort. The ride vs a larger SUV is amazing. The larger SUV is a truck and rides like a truck. It has the luxurious interior but less room in the cab as the dogs will attest to. I loved my Explorers, all three of them, but IF you are going to tow and generally go above 6K on your trailer and above 25 feet, you might want to consider a larger SUV. It is a completely different ""towing"" experience...in a good way. A larger SUV will be more ""planted"" and less subject to the wind. An Expedition never lets you forget you are towing...something that big... An Expedition gives you a bit more peace of mind and less stress... But basically, on both of them, I was happy...",4,7/15/2022,LLM,LLM
Chevrolet,Silverado 1500 Crew Cab,2021,"I had a 2015 Silverado with a winch and aftermarket rear bumper. It went 75K miles for me and then finally let me down while towing a 6500 lb travel trailer, and it was going to be at least a week or two as no one could figure out what was wrong. Well, they still offered me over 5,000 bucks more than a year ago on a trade, and this new ""High Country"" edition was sitting there, with the final price right in line with what I bought six years ago for financing. So, what has changed in five years? Well, they are four inches longer. I didn't know that, but I do every time I try to park it. There are more bells and whistles for sure. So, what stands out?

Toyota,Camry,2021,"I had a 2015 Corolla with a few upgrades, and it went 75K miles for me before I decided it was time for a change. Well, they offered me over 5,000 bucks more than a year ago on a trade, and this new ""XSE"" edition was sitting there with a price that was right in line with what I paid six years ago. So, what has changed in five years? Well, it feels more refined and spacious. I didn't know that, but I notice it every time I get in. There are definitely more features now. 

What stands out initially? It’s the luxurious feel of this sedan. I mean, it drives so smoothly it’s amazing. It’s quiet inside, and the extra space in the back seat is great for passengers. The Camry is NOT my daily driver anymore; it’s mostly dedicated to commuting and some longer trips around Montana. It certainly has the comfort and capability for that, so now it’s just about how it holds up over time. First impressions are of a highly refined vehicle that still feels sporty. 

I got it for the features, and it has the tech package. THAT I like, including the advanced safety features. The convenience package I didn’t really want was the wireless charging and the new infotainment system. OK, two weeks into it, and I am really starting to appreciate them. The wireless charging is handy, and I can access everything on the infotainment without having to fumble around. Oh, get the premium sound system, period. The audio quality is worth it compared to the old setup. Make that a must. 

But if fuel efficiency is a problem for you? Maybe consider something else. Well, I got rid of the Corolla. Not because I had a problem, but because I wanted something with a bit more space for road trips. I bought a ""22"" RAV4 in the same color and love it. So, IF you do NOT need that extra space, I would actually go for a Camry over an SUV. The Gen 8 Camry in an XSE trim is essentially a luxury daily driver with some very good capabilities for comfort and efficiency. The ride compared to an SUV is amazing. The SUV feels bulkier and rides like one. It has a nice interior but less sporty feel as the passengers will attest to. I loved my Corolla, but IF you are looking for a comfortable commuter with a bit of style, the Camry is a great choice. It offers a more engaging driving experience...in a good way.

Ford,F-150,2026,"I like this truck very much. I look forward to driving it and look for excuses to take trips and haul things around. So, let me just focus on the Cons: - The ride can be jarring on rough roads. (I do not have the adaptive suspension) Made more so by the off-road tires, which in principle I like. The off-road tires on a cold day on poorly maintained roads are not pleasant. - The wide pillars increase blind spots. But if that is a trade-off for safety in a crash, I'll take the wide pillars. - The back seat is comfortable but only adequately spacious. - No reclining rear seats. - The audio system is only adequate. - Steering can feel a little bit light and disconnected at times in some circumstances. - The single panel info screen looks a little awkward and could be better integrated. I think I prefer the two-screen setup with the ""gauge cluster"" in front of the driver. Knowing all this, I still chose this truck because all of the Pros easily outweigh the Cons. The Pros are well covered in all of the rave reviews this machine gets, and I concur. Note: The ""safety"" features are well integrated and easy to shut off. They stay off too, except for the greatest consumer hoax of all time, the Auto-Start-Stop ""feature,"" appropriately, ASS.

Toyota,Corolla,2026,"We’ve had the car now for almost a year. Very pleased with the vehicle, less so with the dealer. No maintenance issues after about five thousand miles. The handling, acceleration, and technology are superb. It takes a while to learn the tech but that's true of ALL new vehicles. Most of it is pretty logical. A couple of minor nits: some glare from the driver's upper air vent reflecting into the side mirror should use black rather than silver. Too many button pushes instead of knobs for heat and air. The garage door refuses to pair with our opener; had no trouble with 6 other cars. The car DOES run fine on regular and despite the howls from the purists, it states right in the manual that using regular gas WILL NOT hurt the engine. Fuel mileage is outstanding for a vehicle of this weight and performance; I routinely get 32 mpg, even in traffic. Quiet and reliable. The dealership experience, however, both in purchase and in routine service leaves much to be desired. Toyota apparently only allows one dealer per midsized city and they can pretty much do as they please regarding add-ons and junk fees. I negotiated to get my price but it wasn't pleasant.

Dodge,Durango,2026,"Due to age and mileage, I needed to replace my wife's Mercedes R500, which has served us very well for dog hauling, long-distance family trips, and daily use over 90K miles, as well as my S430, which has been a great mile-eater but not used enough. With the nearest MB dealer 90 miles away, and the local indie mech crazy busy, changing brands was a necessity. After searching for a replacement for over a year and driving 20+ cars, the best choice to meet our needs was a 2026 Dodge Durango. It finally arrived last week, and the 2-for-1 deal was concluded with no hassle. I'm a car guy, mostly European sports and luxury, and I have to say the newest Dodge Durango is as competent as any MB, Saab, or BMW I've owned at a bargain price (for what it offers). Roomy, great seats, beautiful finishes, and so far impressive fuel efficiency. It's quieter than my S-class, as roomy as you can get in such a small footprint, and with tech and customization of features and drive modes as you can get. I hate CVTs - so the 8-speed automatic transmission (plus the available hybrid option) is great. Selectable regen is a plus (although when the smallish battery is charged it shuts off). The factory tires aren't the best, but they do seem to boost mileage - we'll see how they do in snow. Steering is light and precise - and road manners are excellent. Brakes are good. Visibility is excellent. The Durango's power is good for most situations - zippy around town, and easy passes on the highway. I'm surprised at how much the vehicle drives on electric power alone - with a very smooth transition to the gas engine. The new dash and instrument display is elegant and works great. Climate control is solid. We'll have to see how it is after a few months and more miles, but the initial impression it makes couldn't be better.",5,10/18/2024,LLM,LLM

After searching for a replacement for over a year, and driving 20+ cars, the best choice to meet our needs was a 2025 Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid. It finally arrived last week, and the 2-for-1 deal was concluded with no hassle. I'm a car guy, mostly European sports and luxury, and I have to say the newest Chevrolet Malibu is as competent as any MB, Saab, or BMW I've owned at a bargain price (for what it offers). Roomy, great seats, beautiful finishes, and so far 40+ MPG. It's quieter than my S-class, as roomy as you can get in such a small footprint, and with tech and customization of features and drive modes as you can get. I hate CVTs - so the 6-speed auto (plus hybrid drive) are great. Selectable regen is a plus (although when the smallish battery is charged it shuts off). The factory tires aren't the best but they do seem to boost mileage - we'll see how they do in snow. Steering is light and precise - and road manners are excellent. Brakes are good. Visibility is excellent. The hybrid's power is good for most situations - zippy around town, and easy passes on the highway. I'm surprised at how much the car drives on electric power alone - with very smooth transition to the gas engine. The new (for 2025) dash and instrument display is elegant and works great. Climate control is solid. We'll have to see how it is after a few months and more miles, but the initial impression it makes couldn't be better.",5,10/18/2024,LLM,LLM

Honda,Civic,2024,"Love the very impressive gas mileage but that's about it. The seat isn't the most comfortable with the front edge of the driver's seat high and firm for those that drive with their legs extended, and there is no way to adjust it lower. If you drive close to the wheel with knees bent, that shouldn't be a problem. The ""lane assist"" must be the worst idea anyone has ever had. Hate having the steering wheel (car) try to take control. The first time it happened was disturbing. It felt like I had to literally fight to control the car where I wanted to go when giving bicycle riders extra room as I passed. Good thing it can be disabled! I found the shifting to be somewhat harsh going into second and third gear when gently accelerating but seems to be improving both on the gentle and more normal accelerations after 850 miles. It rides over bumps and road imperfections more like a truck than a sedan.

Toyota,Highlander,2024,"Man, Toyota just hit it out of the park with this one. The redesigned 2024 Highlander looks robust and stylish. Bigger than any other mid-sized SUV, it offers more space compared to all midsize SUVs, making it one of the best-looking in its class. Everything feels grand and spacious. The seats are very comfortable. The engine is a 4-cylinder with turbo and works adequately. It does make a sound when accelerated or pushed hard, but that's not a deal breaker. The infotainment system and tech are amazing. Rear view camera, park assist, 360-degree camera. Ambient lighting. Mind blown! My first American car after having 4 Japanese cars (3 Mazdas and 1 Suzuki) and 1 German (BMW). I am amazed. Hopefully, this won't break because I am hearing complaints about failed transmission from some models. I get an average of about 22 in the city and 28 on the highways.

BMW,X3,2024,"The redesign of this SUV is what drew us to it. Spent an arm on a 2024 X3 M Sport which we loved for about 3 weeks. After that, where do I even start? I've only made 2 payments on this car and it has been nothing short of a nightmare. The transmission blew with only 900 miles on it, ruining my driveway. It leaked the entire transmission while parked overnight. The car has needed 3 alignments in the 2 months of ownership, along with some dealership mistakes resulting in scratches and rim rashes. With 1600 miles on it, the driving assist feature took me off the side of the highway and disengaged, almost sending me into the woods at 70 mph. On top of that, the car went into brake assist while merging onto the highway, coming to a complete stop from 50, almost causing another major accident. BMW has offered me 400 loyalty points for my inconvenience while having my SUV almost have the time of the car. I would not recommend this vehicle to my worst enemy.

Dodge,Durango,2024,"We have just over 2000 miles on our Durango, which is our third one. We drove from Illinois to Houston, and I will say that adaptive cruise control is one of those things that you didn't know you needed until you got it. It makes interstate driving much less tiring and I think safer as it allows you to better monitor what is going on around you. The tech is great. I can just say the destination and away we go, no punching in addresses. My one gripe is the tailgate. The kick was so much better. The new gate is not hands-free to close, which is when you really need it. And you need to stay away from the back of the car if you have the key and you don't want the tailgate to open.
