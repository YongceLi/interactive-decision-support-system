Ford,Bronco,Just bought a 24 bronco and it broke down at 20 miles. It had 8 miles on it when I got it and I drove it a whole 12. It's a cheap novelty imo.

Ford,Bronco,"Waited two years on a waiting list and ended up with Badlands and 2.7 with Soft Top. Original Order was for a First Edition and when we were told the Top would not be molded in color due to manufacturing issues, we changed from the limited production First Edition to the combination above. Was completely blown away at the ride and handling versus our Wrangler. Still love the Wrangler, but the Bronco is so much more refined from both on and off road use. The openness of the roll cage versus the Wrangler was a great surprise as well. Had the typical first year production gremlins that i've experienced in Asian, German, and American vehicles we were early adopters of; comes with the territory and Ford stayed in touch and took care of them as they came up. Never driven anything outside of a military HUMMV that was this confidence inspiring off road, in the water, launching jet skis with no boat ramp, i mean at the turn of a dial all the off road modes did what was asked of them. Interior Noise shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who's owned a soft top Jeep. Interior material and drains holes for rinsing the sand and mud out were great.

Tesla,Model-3,"Needed a new car. I had no intention of buying an EV, let alone a Tesla. My wife wanted to check out EVs, so I reluctantly agreed. First we drove some plug-in hybrids. Meh. Then she showed me the price of a Model 3 and I agreed to test drive it. 1. You schedule test drive via online. We found it super convenient. Knew exactly when and where we would be test driving, no waiting in carlot for some idiot car salesman. 2. Sign in, Tesla rep greets us and lets us look around, then explains to us how to use the features. No sales pushing, just answering all our questions. 3. Supposed to be a 30 min test drive, we couldn't stop, went for an hour. It was thought changing. I went from being EV skeptic, to Tesla enthusiast in 60 min. 4. Went online and bought a car that afternoon. Again, no scumbag slimy car salesman, everything straight forward and easy. 5. Did have to download the app to finish the process to fill out the paperwork. But, this was fine, do it from living room couch rather than in a crazy office with some sales idiot bugging you to buy some stupid extras. 6. The only hiccup, app prompts you to pay before picking up car. I just messaged in the app that I preferred to see car before paying. Response, No problem. 7. Pickup fast efficient trouble free. People were great. The whole experience left us thinking, this all works together so well. Everything is well thought out and customer experience well thought out. Car is just a pleasure to drive. Fun, fast, quiet, fast, handles well. Relaxing to drive in traffic. With tax credits, cheaper than a Camry. We did get a wall charger, makes the ownership sooo much better. Just plug it in every night and never worry about range for normal commuting. Day three, first day commuting, we got a weird rock ding and broke front passenger door window. Got home. Called service (they answered fast) and the recommended using app to schedule service. (They offered to schedule over phone, but I wanted to try the app). Tried it, flawless to schedule service. Asked you to describe problem, take some pics and submit. Within minutes, got a message that a mobile appointment was scheduled. App asked for insurance, and that was it. Tech showed up in service time. Fixed window fast, answered a bunch of questions we had about features and then was off. No muss, no fuss. Mobile service was AWESOME! Oh, total cost to us was $0. Fit and finish great Driving in rain great 500 mile road trip with family of four great. Total cost, $16. Time at supercharger, 14 min from 30% to 95%. People complain about no car play/android auto, non issue. Tesla navigation is outstanding. Phone Bluetooth connects for calls. Connectivity lets you connect to streaming services you subscribe to. Don't care about carplay/android auto anymore, its irrelevant. You do have to take some time to learn how to use everything but its time well spent as there's sooo much there for you to tailor the car to how you want things. Tesla Model 3 LWD/AWD.

Ford,F-150,"I purchased the Ford f150 single cab with extended bed, & the 2.7 liter 6 cylinder. Everything was great. I bought the truck because my ford Ranger was getting a lot of miles & having issues. Needed something reliable. On my way home from work, I stopped at the grocery store, when I was ready to leave, I turn the key & it wouldn't start or even crank up at all. My display was showing multiple faults like brakes, camera, blind spot lights, among many other faults. The brake lights came on and wouldn't shut off until the battery went completely dead. It was 7pm. I went to the ford app & ordered a tow truck which did not arrive. By 1am I tried calling the tow truck company & they never answered. I called AAA which I should have done to begin with & even they didn't show up until 6am. I sat in my truck for 11 hrs in the grocery store parking lot totally stranded. By 8am I called the ford dealer to get a tow truck to my house & was furious by that point. A tow truck arrived a couple hours later to take the truck to the dealer I bought it from. The dealer tells me there's 35 vehicles ahead of me waiting for service & it will be a while before they could even look at my truck. It's been 5 days & they still haven't looked at it. The day I bought the truck the sales person told me I wouldn't have any problems but if I did, they would take care of me emediatly. So glad I didn't trade in my 2011 ford ranger because I'm self employed & would be losing a lot of money and business. I bought my 2024 f150 just 6 weeks ago and it's already broke down and unusable!

Honda,CR-V,"Having owned multiple CRVs, I've observed a significant improvement in cabin noise reduction compared to earlier models, particularly when the trunk is open during operation. Furthermore, the headrest design has been enhanced, providing a more comfortable and ergonomic experience compared to previous iterations. Upon Bluetooth connection, the current device does not exhibit the multiple connection attempts observed in the previous model. The inclusion of reclining rear seats is a thoughtful feature, and it would have been particularly appreciated during trips when the children were younger.The vehicle's automatic engine stop-start system, which activates upon brake application, is a feature I find undesirable, despite the option to disable it. The vehicle lacks fog lights . A cargo cover isn't included. Furthermore, the gap is not concealed when the rear seats are in an upright position. It appears that SiriusXM is no longer available as a direct option, and the only way to access it is through streaming. Consequently, my spouse now needs to use a charger or Bluetooth to listen to something other than the radio while driving. I find that adjusting the settings with the steering wheel is somewhat time-consuming. Some individuals have mentioned the absence of a spare tire, whereas all of my vehicles have been equipped with one. Additionally, there is a larger infotainment system. The auto-dimming mirror is a welcome feature. However, the automatic high beams sometimes activate at unexpected moments, so I may need to adjust the settings or disable them entirely.

Honda,CR-V,"I bought the 2026 Honda CR-V Hybrid Sport just two days ago, and Im already extremely frustrated. Before this, I owned a 2017 Ford Explorer Limited, and the difference in quality is simply shocking. The CR-Vs interior feels rushed and careless: cheap, rough plastics, poorly cut panels with even sharp edges. The lower dashboard is so thin and flimsy it feels like it could break with a light touch. The carpet is embarrassingly low quality, and the trunk is poorly designed, with no molded lining to organize the space. To make matters worse, the tailgate doesnt even open with the remote  something that should be standard in any modern car. The infotainment system is laughably basic, with very few features for a car at this price point. The USB ports are outdated and slow  and in 2026, not including a fast-charging USB-C is downright ridiculous. On top of that, there are no parking sensors, neither front nor rear, a feature that has become standard even in much cheaper vehicles. For nearly $40,000, the least you expect is quality and attention to detail. Instead, it feels like Honda only cared about cutting costs to increase profit.

Acura,ADX,"This is has been a great buy so far. The value that you get on the top trim, compared to other luxury entry level SUVs, is simply unbeatable. This trim comes loaded with all the latest driver-assist technology and the music produced by its 15 speaker sound system is outstanding.

Honda,Civic,"My Civic history goes back 50 years to a new 1976 Hatch CVCC, I also had an '80 and '83 of that generation. New baby, low income at the time, long commute, dependable were key considerations. 40 years go by and I got the next Honda - a 2024 ST Hatch last January after ""growing up"" and selling my Golf ""R"". I was disappointed with the driving dynamic and CVT after the Golf R manual. I tested the ST hybrid in November and was amazed by the difference that 20 hp and 50 lb-ft of torque and the difference in ""transmission"" with the electric motor makes. Amazing! Otherwise its the same great CIvic. Nits are the passenger seat position, stock tires, absence of homelink and SXM. I've adapted and accepted the later two. I'll upgrade the tires after I get a year or so out of them. That will improve handling further and maybe the road noise. Passengers will not notice the seating. I'll get a little towel for lumbar support. I paid sticker for the 2024 ST Hatch - $32,500.

Ram,1500,"I had a 2015 Outdoorsman with a winch and after market rear bumper. It went 75K miles for me and then finally let me down while towing a 6500 lb travel trailer and it was going to be at least a week or two as no one could figure out what was wrong. Well, they still offered my over 5,000 bucks more than a year ago on a trade and this new one a ""Built to Serve"" edition was sitting there and the final price was right at the one I bought six years ago for financing. So, what has changed in five years? Well they are four inches longer. I didn't know that but do every time I try to park it. There are more bells and whistles for sure. So, here at first what stands out? It is the luxurious feel of this truck. I mean it is so smooth driving it is amazing. It is quiet inside and the dogs love the back with their extra four inches of space with the seats up out of the way. The truck is NOT my daily driver anymore and is mostly dedicated to towing the trailer and going to the transfer station and some light off roading in interesting places here in Montana. It certainly has the equipment to do that so now it is just seeing how it does over time. First impressions are a highly refined but still assuredly a beast. I got it to tow and it has the tow package. THAT I like including the trailer TPMS monitor. The sleeper package I didn't really want was the Ramboxes and the new ""barn door"" tailgate. OK, two weeks into it and I am really starting to like them. The Ramboxes are huge and FOR MY NEEDS, don't get in the way of space in the bed. AND, Going to the transfer station I open the doors and not the ""tail gate"" and can reach everything instead of having to throw half my body on the tail gate to reach stuff. OH, get the premium light package period. The LED headlights are worth their weight in gold compared to the old ones. Make that a must. But if gas mileage is a problem for you? Get a prius. Well, I got rid of the 1500. Not because I had a problem as such, but because it didn't tow my 6700 lb travel trailer as good as I needed. I bought a ""22"" 2500 in the same color and love it. So, IF you do NOT tow over 6000 lbs, I would actually go for a 1500 over a 2500. The Gen 5 1500 in a Bighorn trim and up is essentially a luxury daily driver with some very good capabilities for towing...up to around 6K in perfect comfort. The ride vs a 2500 is amazing. The 2500 is a truck and rides like a truck. It has the luxurious interior but less room in the cab as the dogs will attest to. I loved my 1500's all three of them, but IF you are going to tow and generally go above 6K on your trailer and above 25 feet, you might want to consider a 2500. It is a completely different ""towing"" experience...in a good way. A 2500 will be more ""planted"" and less subject to the wind. A 1500 never lets you forget you are towing...something that big... A 2500 gives you a bit more peace of mind and less stress...

BMW,X5,"I like this car very much. I look forward to driving it and look for excuses to drive around and trips to take. So, let me just focus on the Cons: - The ride is jarring on rough roads. (I do not have the air suspension) Made more so by the run flat tires, which in principle I like. The run flats on a cold day on poorly maintained road is not pleasant. - The wide pillars increase blind spots. But if that is a trade off for safety in a crash, I'll take the wide pillars. - Back seat is comfortable but only adequately spacious. - No reclining rear seats. - Harmon Kardon system is only adequate. - Steering can be a little bit light and disconnected at times in some circumstances. - The single panel info screen looks a little awkward and could be better integrated. I think I prefer the two screen set-up with the ""gauge cluster"" buried in front of the driver. Knowing all this I still chose this car because all of Pros easily outweigh the Cons. The Pros are well covered in all of the rave reviews this machine gets, and I conquer. Note: The ""safety"" features are well integrated and easy to shut off. They stay off too, except for the greatest consumer hoax of all time, the Auto-Start-Stop ""feature"", appropriately, ASS.

BMW,X5,"Weve had the car now for almost a year. Very pleased with the vehicle, less so with the dealer. No maintenance issues after about five thousand miles. The handling, acceleration, and technology are superb. It takes awhile to learn the tech but thats true of ALL new vehicles. Most of it is pretty logical. A couple of minor nits: some glare from the drivers upper air vent reflecting into the side mirror should use black rather than silver. Too many button pushes instead of knobs for heat and air. Garage door refuses to pair with our opener had no trouble with 6 other cars. The car DOES run fine on regular and despite the howls from the purists, it states right in the manual that using regular gas WILL NOT hurt the engine. Fuel mileage is outstanding for a vehicle of this weight and performance I routinely get 28 mpg, even if traffic. Quiet and elegant. The dealership experience, however, both in purchase and in routine service leaves much to be desired. BMW apparently only allows one dealer per midsized city and they can pretty much do as they please regarding add-ons and junk fees. I negotiated to get my price but it wasnt pleasant. They insisted on 5 star reviews when the delivery for a luxury vehicle was 3.5 stars , maybe. The salesperson was upset when I gave them an honest review.

Hyundai,Tucson,"Due to age and mileage, I needed to replace my wife's Mercedes R500, which has served us very well for dog hauling, long-distance family trips, and daily use over 90K miles, as well as my S430, which has been a great mile-eater but not used enough. With the nearest MB dealer 90 miles away, and the local indie mech crazy busy, changing brands was a necessity. After searching for a replacement for over a year, and driving 20+ cars, the best choice to meet our needs was a 2025 Tucson Hybrid. It finally arrived last week, and the 2-for-1 deal was concluded with no hassle. I'm a car guy, mostly European sports and luxury, and I have to say the the newest Hyundai Tucson is as competent as any MB, Saab or BMW I've owned at a bargain price (for what it offers). Roomy, great seats, beautiful finishes, and so far 40+ MPG. It's quieter than my S-class, as roomy as you can get in such a small footprint, and with tech and customization of features and drive modes as you can get. I hate CVT's - so the 6-speed auto (plus hybrid drive) are great. Selectable regen is a plus (although when the smallish battery is charged it shuts off). The factory tires aren't the best but they do seem to boost mileage - we'll see how they do in snow. Steering is light and precise - and road manners are excellent. Brakes are good. Visibility is excellent. The hybrid's power is good for most situations - zippy around town, and easy passes on the highway. I'm surprised at how much the car drives on electric power alone - with very smooth transition to the gas engine. The new (for 2025) dash and instrument display is elegant and works great. Climate control is solid.

Chevrolet,Traverse,"Man, Chevrolet just hit it out of the park with this one. The redesigned 2024 Traverse looks like a truck.
