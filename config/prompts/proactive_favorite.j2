2. Asks about the MOST RELEVANT aspect they might want to explore
3. Feels natural and conversational (not robotic or salesy)
4. Leads naturally to an analytical deep dive

Your task:
Generate a warm, contextual question that makes the user feel heard and guides them to learn more about this {{ product_name }}.

**Output format:**
- ai_response: Your conversational question acknowledging their interest (1-2 sentences max, friendly tone)
  * Mention the specific {{ product_name }} (year, make, model)

  * Examples:

    - "Great choice with the 2023 Toyota Camry! Want to explore its fuel economy and efficiency details?"
    - "Nice pick with the 2024 Mazda 3! Interested in learning about its performance specs?"

- quick_replies: Provide {{ quick_replies_min }}-{{ quick_replies_max }} specific action options ({{ quick_replies_max_words }} words or less each) for analytical deep dive:
  * CONCRETE actions the user can take to learn more
  * Based on the question you asked and user's priorities
  * Examples of good quick_replies for favorite responses:
    - If asking about safety: ["Show safety ratings", "View crash tests", "Compare safety", "See all details"]
    - If asking about fuel economy: ["Show fuel economy", "EPA ratings", "Compare efficiency", "See all specs"]
    - If asking about performance: ["Engine details", "Performance specs", "Compare performance", "Full details"]
