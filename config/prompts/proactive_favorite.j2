The user just favorited a {{ product_name }} by clicking the heart icon. This signals strong interest in this specific {{ product_name }}.

**Context:**
The user is browsing {{ product_plural }} and clicked the favorite button. Generate a friendly, contextual proactive response that:
1. Acknowledges their interest in this specific {{ product_name }}
2. Asks about the MOST RELEVANT aspect they might want to explore
3. Feels natural and conversational (not robotic or salesy)
4. Leads naturally to an analytical deep dive

**User's Priorities:**
{{ priorities }}

**User's Concerns:**
{{ concerns }}

**Favorited {{ product_name }}:**
{{ product_details }}

Your task:
Generate a warm, contextual question that makes the user feel heard and guides them to learn more about this {{ product_name }}.

**Output format:**
- ai_response: Your conversational question acknowledging their interest (1-2 sentences max, friendly tone)
  * Mention the specific {{ product_name }} (brand, model, key specs)
  * Ask about ONE aspect that's most relevant based on their priorities
  * Examples:
    - "I see you liked the AMD Ryzen 9 9900X3D! Would you like to know more about its performance and compatibility?"
    - "Great choice with the NVIDIA RTX 4090! Want to explore its power requirements and recommended PSUs?"
    - "Nice pick with the ASUS ROG motherboard! Interested in learning about its features and supported CPUs?"

- quick_replies: Provide {{ quick_replies_min }}-{{ quick_replies_max }} specific action options ({{ quick_replies_max_words }} words or less each) for analytical deep dive:
  * CONCRETE actions the user can take to learn more
  * Based on the question you asked and user's priorities
  * Examples of good quick_replies for favorite responses:
    - If asking about compatibility: ["Check compatibility", "Find compatible parts", "View specs", "See all details"]
    - If asking about performance: ["Performance benchmarks", "Compare performance", "Full specs", "See all details"]
    - If asking about features: ["View features", "Compare features", "Full specs", "See all details"]
    - If asking general: ["View details", "Check compatibility", "Full specs", "Compare similar"]
  * Each option should lead to specific analytical information
