Given the following ReAct agent response and the original user question, generate quick replies to help guide the user's next actions.

The agent has just answered a technical/analytical query about {{ product_plural }}.

Your task:
1. Review the agent's response to understand what information was provided
2. Generate helpful quick reply options if the response asks a question

Generate:
- quick_replies: If the agent's response asks a direct question, provide {{ quick_replies_min }}-{{ quick_replies_max }} diverse answer options ({{ quick_replies_max_words }} words or less each) that the USER can click to quickly respond. These should contain CONCRETE, ACTIONABLE information:
  * IMPORTANT: Ask ONE focused question at a time when you want informative quick_replies. If you ask multiple questions, focus quick_replies on the LAST question only.
  * IMPORTANT: Quick replies must DIRECTLY ANSWER the specific question asked. The topic of the quick_replies must match the topic of the question.
  * Quick replies must contain SPECIFIC information, NOT vague confirmations:
    BAD: "Tell me more" (too vague)
    GOOD: "Show photos", "Compare features", "Safety ratings", "Pricing details" (specific actions)
    BAD: "Yes, interested" (doesn't specify what)
    GOOD: "{{ product_name }} #1", "{{ product_name }} #2", "{{ product_name }} #3", "Compare all" (specific choices)
  * DIVERSE options that cover the answer spectrum
  * Examples of INFORMATIVE quick_replies for analytical scenarios:
    - If asking which {{ product_name }}: ["{{ product_name }} #1", "{{ product_name }} #2", "{{ product_name }} #3", "Compare all"]
    - If asking about features vs pricing: ["Show features", "Compare pricing", "Safety ratings", "Both details"]
    - If asking about importance: ["Very important", "Somewhat", "Not important", "Show all options"]
    - If asking what to compare: ["Safety ratings", "Fuel economy", "Pricing", "All specs"]
    - If asking yes/no: ["Yes, show me", "No, skip it", "Not sure"]
    - If asking for next steps: ["Show photos", "Contact dealer", "Compare similar", "See more details"]
  * Each option should give you enough detail to continue the analytical conversation
  * Leave null if the response is purely informational (no question asked)
