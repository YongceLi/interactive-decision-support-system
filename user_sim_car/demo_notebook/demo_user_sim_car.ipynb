      "- Family:      The user comes from a small family, likely consisting of just a few immediate members, who live in various parts of Arizona. They maintain a close-knit relationship with their family, often gathering for casual weekend barbecues or holiday celebrations. While their family doesn't have specific preferences for vehicles, they value practicality and reliability, which influences the user's own car shopping decisions.\n",
      "- Writing:     The user tends to write in a straightforward and concise manner, often favoring short sentences that get straight to the point. Their spelling and grammar are generally correct but may incorporate some informal elements, like texting slang, particularly in casual contexts. Consistency in tone is maintained, reflecting a practical mindset focused on clarity and efficiency in communication.\n",
      "- Interaction: The user prefers clear, straightforward communication and tends to focus on one question or topic at a time, which allows for more precise and manageable exchanges. Their writing style is brief, often incorporating texting slang, reflecting a desire for efficiency in interactions. This approach indicates a preference for direct responses that address their specific inquiries without unnecessary elaboration.\n",
      "- Intent:      The user is focused on comparing options for affordable used sedans or hatchbacks that meet their budget and fuel efficiency needs. They are likely researching various models and reading reviews to ensure reliability and low maintenance costs. The goal is to pinpoint the best fit within their price range while considering factors like mileage and overall upkeep.\n",
