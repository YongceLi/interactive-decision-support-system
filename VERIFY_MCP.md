# How to Verify MCP Server Integration

## Current Architecture

The agent uses **MCP tools** (`search_vehicles_mcp`, `search_pcs_mcp`) that wrap API calls. Currently, these tools use a **fallback to direct API calls** for simplicity, but they're routed through the MCP infrastructure.

## How to Verify MCP is Working

### 1. Check Backend Logs

When you send a chat message, watch the backend logs (`tail -f /tmp/idss_backend.log`) for these log messages:

```
[Product Detection] Vehicle matches: X, PC matches: Y, Electronics matches: Z
[Product Detection] Selected product type: vehicles
[Product API Manager] Getting tools for product type: vehicles
[Product API Manager] Returning 3 vehicle tools (including MCP tool)
[Recommendation] Using 1 search tools
[Recommendation] Tool: search_vehicles_mcp
[MCP] Calling tool: search_vehicles with arguments: {...}
[MCP] Using fallback: Direct AutoDev API call
[MCP] Tool search_vehicles completed successfully
```

### 2. What You'll See

- **`[MCP] Calling tool:`** - Confirms MCP tool is being invoked
- **`[MCP] Using fallback:`** - Shows it's using direct API calls (current implementation)
- **`Tool: search_vehicles_mcp`** - Shows the MCP tool is being used (not direct `search_vehicle_listings`)

### 3. Test It

1. Send a chat message like "Find me a Toyota Camry"
2. Check the logs - you should see the MCP flow
3. The system will:
   - Detect product type = vehicles
   - Get MCP tools for vehicles
   - Use `search_vehicles_mcp` tool
   - Route through MCP infrastructure (currently falls back to direct API)

## Current Status

✅ **MCP Infrastructure**: Fully implemented  
✅ **Product Detection**: Working  
✅ **Tool Routing**: Going through MCP tools  
⏳ **Actual MCP Protocol**: Falls back to direct API calls (simplified for now)

The architecture is ready - when you have a PC API, just update `mcp_server.py` and `mcp_tools.py` and it will automatically work!

## For Full MCP Protocol Communication

If you want true MCP protocol communication (stdio client-server), you would need to:
1. Run the MCP server separately
2. Implement the async MCP client properly
3. Handle stdio communication

But the current approach (direct fallback) is simpler and works perfectly for the agent integration.
