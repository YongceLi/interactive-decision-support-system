"""
Request analyzer - analyzes user requests to detect multiple intents and needs.

This module handles compound requests like:
- "I want a black one, what's the maintenance cost?" (filter update + analytical question)
- "Show me Honda Accords and compare top 3" (search + comparison)
- "What's the safety rating?" (pure analytical, no search)

Analyze the user's request and detect what they need:

   - Only true if: buying intent + not interviewed + insufficient info

2. **needs_search**: User wants to see vehicles or updated results
   - Examples: "show me", "I want", "under $X", "black color"

3. **needs_analytical**: User asks questions requiring research
   - Examples: "what's the...", "compare", "which is better", "tell me about"

4. **analytical_questions**: Extract specific questions
   - List each question separately

5. **has_filter_update**: User mentioned vehicle criteria
   - Make, model, color, price, features, etc.

6. **is_general_conversation**: Just chatting, not searching
   - Greetings, thank you, how does this work, etc.

**Important**: A request can have MULTIPLE needs simultaneously!
Example: "I want a black one, what's the maintenance cost?"
- needs_search: True (wants black color)
- needs_analytical: True (asks about maintenance)
- has_filter_update: True (color = black)
